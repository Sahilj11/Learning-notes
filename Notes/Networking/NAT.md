- Public IP must be unique , as we cannot use private IP , internal router might have same IP on multiple part of world . but the external router to which it is connected to has unique public IP. if i want to access internet NAT allow me to borrow the unique IP of the external router or the public IP i have configured for NAT . multiple device can use the same public IP
