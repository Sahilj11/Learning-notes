# UNIT 1
## Intro/Defination
- Cloud computing: A procedure for enabling network-based, on-demand access to a shared pool of computer resources, such as servers, storage, applications, and services (usually the internet). With little assistance from management or service providers, these resources may be released and deployed quickly allowing users to scale their use up or down as needed.
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): a cloud service delivery paradigm that gives consumers pay-per-use access to virtualized computer resources like servers, storage, and networking parts. The virtualized infrastructure that IaaS consumers normally control can be changed, but are responsible for managing and maintaining their own software applications and data
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): a cloud service paradigm that offers users a network-based environment for creating, deploying, and managing software applications. PaaS users typically have access to a pre-configured platform that includes tools, libraries, and other resources to facilitate software development and deployment, while the operating system and supporting infrastructure are taken care of by the service provide
- Software as a Service (SaaS): a cloud service paradigm that enables customers to connect to and utilise software hosted and controlled by a service provider over a network. SaaS users typically pay a subscription fee and have little control over the underlying infra or code

## Evolution
- Early Days:-In the early days of computing, businesses and organizations relied on mainframe computers to store and process their data. These mainframes were large, expensive, and required a dedicated team of IT professionals to manage them
- Birth of internet:- The birth of the internet in the 1990s revolutionized the way we store and access information. With the internet, it became possible to share data and applications across different locations and devices. This created the framework for the growth of cloud computing.
- Emergence of Cloud Computing:- he term "cloud computing" was coined in 2006 by Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google at the time. Cloud computing was born out of the need to provide businesses with more flexibility and scalability in their IT infrastructure. Cloud computing enables organisations to access and store data and apps online, without the need for on-site servers or IT staff.
- Evolution of cloud computing:- Since its inception, cloud computing has evolved significantly. In the early days, cloud computing was primarily used for storage and data backup. Today, cloud computing has expanded to include a variety of services, such as software as a service, platform as a service, and infrastructure as a service (SaaS)

## Cloud Deployment Models
- The four primary cloud deployment models—public, private, hybrid, and community cloud
### Public
A sort of cloud computing architecture known as the "public cloud" allows for the delivery
of cloud services via the internet by independent cloud providers. It is available to the
general public, and anyone can use it by paying a fee or on a pay-per-use basis. Public
clouds provide scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, which makes them ideal for
small and medium-sized businesses. Public cloud services include SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS
### Private Cloud
An organisation or a single entity owns and manages a private cloud, commonly referred
to as an internal or corporate cloud. It is not accessible to the public, and its services are
available only to authorized users within the organization. Private cloud services are
designed to meet the specific requirements of an organization and provide complete control
over data security and privacy. Private clouds are ideal for organizations that require a high
level of security, compliance, and customization.
### Hybrid Cloud
Public and private cloud deployment models are combined to create a hybrid cloud. It gives
businesses the freedom to select the optimum cloud deployment approach for their
particular requirements. With a hybrid cloud, businesses can use private cloud services for
sensitive data and public cloud services for less-sensitive data. For businesses that need the
advantages of both public and private cloud deployment options, hybrid clouds are the best
option.
### Community Cloud
A community cloud is a kind of cloud deployment platform that several businesses with
comparable objectives or needs share.. It is a collaborative platform where organizations
share resources, applications, and infrastructure to achieve their common objectives.
Community clouds are suitable for industries such as healthcare, government, education,
and finance, where organizations have to comply with strict regulations and share common
resources.

## Virtualization and Cloud Computing
### Definition
Virtualization: A virtual version of something, such as an operating system, server, storage
device, or network resource, can be created through the process of virtualization. It entails
adding an abstraction layer between the physical hardware and the software that runs on it,
allowing several operating systems or applications to effectively share resources on a single
physical computer

Server virtualization: The process of splitting a physical server into several virtual
machines (VMs), each with its own operating system and applications, is known as server
virtualization. As a result, hardware costs are decreased, resource utilisation is increased 
and flexibility and scalability are provided. It also enables the running of different
workloads on a single physical server.


Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): A web service called Amazon EC2 offers
scalable compute capability in the cloud. By only paying for the capacity they actually use,
it enables users to rapidly and easily deploy and scale virtual servers on Amazon's
infrastructure. EC2 is a crucial part of Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cloud platform that
provides a wide range of services to assist businesses in developing and deploying cloud-
based applications.


## Hypervisor Overview

- A hypervisor, also called a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), allows multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine.
    
- It creates a virtual environment where each VM operates independently from the underlying hardware.
    
- Each VM can run its own operating system.
    
- The hypervisor allocates hardware resources like CPU, memory, and storage to each VM as needed.
    

## Types of Hypervisors

1. **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-metal or Native Hypervisor)**
    
    - Runs directly on the physical hardware.
        
    - More efficient and secure compared to Type 2 hypervisors.
        
    - Commonly used in enterprise environments.
        
2. **Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor)**
    
    - Runs on top of the host machine’s operating system.
        
    - Easier to set up for personal or small-scale use, but generally less efficient.
        

## Benefits of Virtualization

- **Server Consolidation**
    
    - Multiple VMs can run on a single physical server.
        
    - Reduces the need for additional hardware and lowers associated costs.
        
- **Rapid Provisioning**
    
    - Enables quick deployment of new systems.
        
    - Facilitates faster response to business needs.
        
- **Improved Reliability and Availability**
    
    - In case of physical server failure, VMs can be migrated to another server without downtime.
        
    - Feature known as VM migration or live migration.
        
- **Enhanced Security**
    
    - Each VM is isolated from others, minimizing the risk of breaches across VMs.
        
- **Sandbox Testing**
    
    - New applications or software can be tested in an isolated environment.
        
    - Protects the production environment from potential disruptions.

## Virtual Migration Techniques
Moving a virtual machine (VM) from one physical host to another, whether it is active or
not, is known as virtual machine migration. This operation is typically done to balance the
workload or carry out maintenance without interrupting services. Virtualization and cloud
computing are not complete without VM migration solutions, which give administrators
the opportunity to maximise resource utilisation and improve service availability.
### 1. Live Migration
- Moves an active virtual machine (VM) from one physical host to another **without stopping** its services.
- Requires a **shared storage infrastructure** that allows both physical hosts to access the same disk images.
- Commonly used to:
    - Optimize resource usage,
    - Balance workloads,
    - Perform maintenance tasks without downtime.
- Widely used in cloud computing to enhance availability and resource optimization.

### 2. Cold Migration
- Involves **stopping** the VM before moving it to another physical host.
- The VM's disk image is copied to the new host and then started.
- Does **not** require shared storage infrastructure.
- Simple and reliable, but causes **brief service interruption**, making it less ideal for critical services.

### 3. Storage Migration
- Transfers a VM's **storage** from one physical host to another.
- Often used along with live or cold migration to:
    - Move VMs to faster or larger storage systems,
    - Support business continuity and disaster recovery.
- Can relocate a VM’s storage to a different physical location if needed.

### 4. Cross-Platform Migration
- Moves a VM from one **virtualization platform** to another.
- Useful for:
    - Migrating from legacy to modern virtualization platforms,
    - Consolidating multiple platforms into a single one.
- Requires **conversion** of the VM’s disk image and configuration to a new format.    
- Can be complex and time-consuming.
