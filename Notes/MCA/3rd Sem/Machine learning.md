# Unit 1

### Performance measure of learning
1. Generality:- refers to ML model's ability to perform well accross various datasets and environment, not just one it was trained on.
2. Efficiency:- How quickly a model can learn from data. A spam detection algorithm that quickly adapts to new type of spam emails
3. Robustness:- ability of a model to handle errors, noise and unexcpected data without failing. A voice recognition system able to recognize voice in a noisy room.
4. Efficacy:- overall effectiveness of a ML model in performing its intended tasks.
5. Ease of implementation:- how straightforward is it to develop and deploy a ML model.

### Supervised learning
- involves training a machine learning model using labeled data, which means the **data is already associated with correct answer**.
  Eg: predicting house prices based on features like size and location, using a dataset where prices are known, allows the model to learn and make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

#### Steps in Supervised learning
- input and output pairing:- each input is paired with its correct label.
- training:- model learns by compairing its prediction with actual label and adjusting itself to improve accuracy.
- error correction:- if model predicts incorrectly it adjusts its internal parameters to reduce error.
- outcome:- model eventually learn to map input to correct output.

### Unsupervised learning
- involves training model without any label , which means the model tries to identify patterns and data groupings on its own.
  Eg: Imagine placing a mix of different coins on a table and asking to sort them. without explaining any criteria , the child might start grouping by size,color etc.

#### Steps 
- input without labels:- the model receives data without any explicit instructions on what to do with it.
- pattern recognition:- model analyze data and tries to find any natural grouping or patterns.
- self-organisation:- model organise data into different categories based on the patterns it receives.
- outcome:- model creates its own system of categorization without external guidance.

### machine learning
- subset of AI allows computers to learn from and make decisions based on data,without being explicitly programmed.
- involves developing algorithm that allow computers to process and learn from data automatically.

> Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.

### Types of ML
Machine learning is generally categorized into three main types based on how the learning process is structured and the nature of the feedback the model receives. Here are the three primary types:

#### 1. **Supervised Learning**

**Description**: In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that can be used to predict the labels for new, unseen data.

**Examples**:
- **Classification**: Email spam detection, sentiment analysis, image classification.
- **Regression**: Predicting house prices, stock market forecasting, temperature prediction.

**Key Algorithms**:
- Linear Regression

### Clustering
- Process of sorting items into groups based on their similarities forming distant clusters where items within each cluster are more alike each other than to those in other cluster.
- entails discovering patterns without explicit guidance, akin to exploring a forest without a map , where similarities guide the grouping process. it's a form of unsupervised learning akin to solving a puzzle without knowledge of final solution.

### K mean clustering

K-Means Clustering is one of the most popular unsupervised learning algorithms used to partition a dataset into distinct groups, or clusters. The goal is to divide the data points into k clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid), resulting in clusters of similar data points.

#### 1. Key Concepts
- Clusters: Groups of similar data points.
- Centroid: The center of a cluster. Each centroid is the mean of all points in that cluster.
- Distance Measure: Typically, Euclidean distance is used to measure how close a data point is to a centroid.
#### 2. The K-Means Algorithm
- The K-Means algorithm follows these steps:

**Initialization:**

Select k, the number of clusters.
Randomly choose k initial centroids from the dataset.
Assignment Step:

Assign each data point to the nearest centroid. This forms k clusters.
Update Step:

Recalculate the centroids by taking the mean of all data points in each cluster.
Repeat:

Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centroids no longer change significantly, indicating convergence.
Final Clusters:

Once the centroids stabilize, the algorithm outputs the final clusters.
