# Digital logical Gates
## Basic Digital circuit
### What is it 
A digital circuit is a circuit that operates using digital signals, which are discrete signals represented by binary numbers (0s and 1s). These circuits are designed to process, store, and transmit digital information using a combination of logic gates and other digital components.

Digital circuits are built from electronic components such as transistors, diodes, resistors, and capacitors. These components are interconnected to form logic gates, flip-flops, registers, counters, and other digital elements. The behavior of digital circuits is determined by the logical operations performed on binary inputs to produce binary outputs.

In a digital system there are only a few basic operations performed, irrespective of the complexities of the system.  The basic operations are AND, OR, NOT, and FLIP-FLOP(which is a basic memory element used to store binary information (one bit is stored in one FLIP-FLOP)).

**An integrated circuit (IC) is a small semiconductor chip that contains electronic components such as transistors, diodes, resistors, and capacitors, as well as interconnections between them, all fabricated onto a single piece of semiconductor material. Integrated circuits are also commonly referred to as microchips or simply chips.**
### Combinational vs Sequential circuit 
Combinational and sequential circuits are two fundamental types of digital circuits, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

**Combinational Circuits:**

1. **Definition**: Combinational circuits produce outputs solely based on the current input values, without any memory or feedback. The outputs are determined by the logical combination of the input signals.

2. **Behavior**: The outputs of a combinational circuit are purely a function of the current input values. There is no notion of time dependency or sequential behavior. These circuits are essentially "stateless" in that they do not have memory elements to retain information.

3. **Examples**: Combinational circuits include logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.), multiplexers, demultiplexers, decoders, encoders, and adders.

4. **Applications**: Combinational circuits are used for tasks such as logical operations, arithmetic operations, data routing, data conversion, and encoding/decoding. They are suitable for applications where the output depends solely on the current input values and there is no need for memory or sequential behavior.

**Sequential Circuits:**

1. **Definition**: Sequential circuits contain memory elements (such as flip-flops or latches) that allow them to store information internally. The outputs of a sequential circuit depend not only on the current input values but also on the circuit's previous state.

2. **Behavior**: Sequential circuits exhibit time dependency and sequential behavior. The outputs are determined by the current input values as well as the circuit's internal state, which is influenced by past inputs and outputs.

3. **Examples**: Sequential circuits include flip-flops, registers, counters, shift registers, finite state machines (FSMs), and memory units.

4. **Applications**: Sequential circuits are used in applications where past history or sequential behavior is important, such as in digital clocks, microprocessors, memory units, control systems, and communication protocols. They are capable of storing and processing data over time, making them essential for tasks requiring memory or sequential logic.

In summary, combinational circuits produce outputs solely based on the current input values, without any memory, while sequential circuits incorporate memory elements to retain past information, resulting in outputs that depend on both current inputs and past states. Both types of circuits have unique characteristics and are used in various digital systems based on the specific requirements of the application.

**Logic Gate:-** fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. They perform basic logical functions that are essential for digital computing. Each gate implements a Boolean function, which takes one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.
#### **AND Gate**:
   - Definition: An AND gate is a digital logic gate that produces a high (binary 1) output only when all of its inputs are high (binary 1). Otherwise, it produces a low (binary 0) output.

![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240301072816.png)
#### **NOR Gate**:
   - A NOR gate is a digital logic gate that produces a high (binary 1) output only when all of its inputs are low (binary 0). It produces a low (binary 0) output if at least one input is high.
   - Symbol: Often represented by an OR gate followed by a small circle (inversion) at the output.

![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240301073001.png)
#### **XOR Gate (Exclusive OR)**:
   - Definition: An XOR gate is a digital logic gate that produces a high (binary 1) output if the number of high inputs is odd. It produces a low (binary 0) output if the number of high inputs is even.
   - Symbol: Represented by a curved line with inputs on both sides and the output at the apex.
   - Boolean expression: The output \(Y\) of an XOR gate with inputs \(A\) and \(B\) is given by \(Y = A \oplus B\), where \(\oplus\) denotes XOR operation.
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240301073023.png)
These logical gates serve as the basic building blocks of digital circuits, allowing for the manipulation and processing of binary data in various electronic systems.

# Boolean algebra
The number of gates and the number of input terminals for the gates required for the realization of a
logical expression, in general, get reduced considerably if the expression can be simplified. Therefore, the simplification of logical expression is very important as it saves the hardware required to design a specific system

### Boolean Algebra intro
Boolean algebra is a mathematical discipline that deals with the manipulation and analysis of logical expressions and functions.deals with binary values, where variables and expressions can take on only two possible values: true (often represented as 1 or "high") and false (often represented as 0 or "low").

# Combinational Circuit
## Adder (Example of arithemetic circuit)
In many computers and other types of processors, adders are used to calculate addresses, similar operations and table indices in the ALU and also in other parts of the processors. 

### Types 
#### Half adder
A combinational circuit that performs the arithmetic addition of two bits is called a halfadder. One that performs the addition of three bits (two significant bits and a previous carry) is called a full-adder.
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302071058.png)
The input variables of a half-adder are called the augend and addend bits. The output variables the sum and carry
#### Full adder
A full adder is a combinational circuit used in digital electronics to perform addition of two binary numbers. Unlike a half adder, which can only add two single bits, a full adder can also take into account a carry bit from a previous addition operation, allowing it to add three bits: two bits from the numbers being added (typically denoted as x and y), and a carry-in bit (denoted as z).
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302071643.png)

## Subtractor 
Subtractor circuits take two binary numbers as input and subtract one binary number
input from the other binary number input. Similar to adders, it gives out two outputs,
difference and borrow (carry-in the case of Adder).
### Half subtractor 
Half subtractor is a combination circuit with two inputs and two outputs (difference and borrow). It produces the difference between the two binary bits at the input and also produces an output (Borrow) to indicate if a 1 has been borrowed. In the subtraction (AB), A is called as Minuend bit and B is called as Subtrahend bit.
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302071845.png)

### Full Subtractor
The disadvantage of a half subtractor is overcome by full subtractor. The full subtractor is a combinational circuit with three inputs A,B,C and two output D and C'. A is the 'minuend', B is 'subtrahend', C is the 'borrow' produced by the previous stage, D is the difference output and C' is the borrow output.
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302072009.png)

## Decoder
A decoder is a combinational circuit in digital electronics that takes binary-coded inputs and converts them into a corresponding set of output signals. Each unique combination of input bits corresponds to a specific output signal.
Used to convert binary to other codes :
1. Binary to octal
2. Binary to Hexa
3. Binary to Decimal

***The decoders presented in this section are called n-to-m-line decoders, where m â‰¤ 2n. Their purpose is to generate the 2n (or fewer) binary combinations of the n input variables. A decoder has n inputs and m outputs and is also referred to as an n x m decoder.***
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302075608.png)

here for each input combination  a single output line is active
### NAND Decoder
Some decoders are constructed with NAND instead of AND gates. Since a NAND gate produces the AND operation with an inverted output, it becomes more economical to generate the decoder outputs in their complement form. 

By using NAND gates, the need for separate inverters to generate output complements is eliminated. This simplifies the overall circuit design and reduces the number of components required, resulting in a more economical solution.
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302075544.png)

### Decoder expansion
There are occasions when a certain-size decoder is needed but only smaller sizes are available. When this occurs it is possible to combine two or more decoders with enable inputs to form a larger decoder
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302080727.png)

## Encoder
An encoder is a digital circuit that performs the inverse operation of the decoder. An encoder has 2n (or less) input lines and n output lines. The output lines generate the binary code corresponding to the input value
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302080911.png)
## Multiplexer
It is a combinational circuit that has 2<sup>n</sup> input lines and single output line. n will be number of select lines
it is a electronic switch that connect 1 out of n input to output
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240519064142.png)

![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240303072829.png)
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240303072849.png)
## De-multiplexer
A demultiplexer, often abbreviated as "demux," is a digital circuit or device used in digital electronics and telecommunications. It takes a single input signal and directs it to one of several possible output lines based on the state of its control inputs.
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240303073053.png)

Demultiplexers are essentially the opposite of multiplexers. While multiplexers combine multiple input signals into a single output, demultiplexers take a single input and distribute it to multiple outputs.

Demultiplexers are commonly used in various applications, including:

1. Data transmission: In digital communication systems, demultiplexers are used to route individual data streams from a single transmission line to multiple receivers.

2. Memory systems: Demultiplexers can be used to select specific memory locations or address lines in memory devices.

3. Display systems: In display technology, demultiplexers help in selecting individual segments or pixels in a display matrix.

4. Address decoding: Demultiplexers are used to decode address lines in microprocessor systems, enabling the selection of specific peripheral devices or memory locations.

Demultiplexers come in various configurations, such as 1-to-2, 1-to-4, 1-to-8, etc., depending on the number of output lines they have. They are essential components in digital circuits and play a crucial role in routing and managing data and signals.

![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240519065849.png)
### Advantages of K-map

1. **Visual Simplification**: Easier to see and group terms compared to algebraic methods.
2. **Error Reduction**: Less prone to errors than manual Boolean algebra manipulation.
3. **Efficiency**: Quickly simplifies complex Boolean expressions.

### Limitations of K-map

1. **Scalability**: Becomes impractical for functions with more than 5 or 6 variables due to the complexity and size of the map.
2. **Manual Process**: Still requires careful manual grouping and interpretation.
# Sequential Logic
## Intro
A sequential circuit is an interconnection of flip-flops and gates. The gates by themselves constitute a combinational circuit, but when included with the flip-flops, the overall circuit is classified as a sequential circuit.
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240303073627.png)

## Flip Flops
- it is a binary cell capable of storing one bit of data
- it is a sequential circuit
- contains memory element to store past output
- has two outputs 
	- normal 
	- complement
- A flip-flop maintains a binary state until directed by a clock pulse to switch states. The difference among various types of flip-flops is in the number of inputs they possess and in the manner in which the inputs affect the binary state

### Use of clock signal in flip flop
In the context of flip-flops, a "clock" refers to a signal that controls the timing of when the flip-flop changes its state. Flip-flops are sequential logic circuits that store binary data in the form of a one-bit memory. The clock signal acts as a trigger for the flip-flop to read the input data and either latch or change its state accordingly.

When the clock signal transitions from one state to another (e.g., from low to high or high to low, depending on the type of flip-flop and its configuration), the flip-flop samples the input data and updates its output accordingly. This sampling process typically occurs on the rising or falling edge of the clock signal, depending on the specific design of the flip-flop.

The use of a clock signal allows for synchronized operation of multiple flip-flops within a digital circuit, ensuring that data is processed and transferred at the correct times. It also helps in controlling the timing of operations and prevents race conditions that can occur in asynchronous systems.

Different types of flip-flops, such as D flip-flops, JK flip-flops, and T flip-flops, utilize the clock signal in slightly different ways, but in all cases, the clock serves as a crucial timing element for the proper functioning of the flip-flop circuit.

Different types of flip-flops use the clock signal in slightly different ways. Here's how some common types of flip-flops utilize the clock signal:

1. **D Flip-Flop**:
   - In a D flip-flop (Data flip-flop), the input data (D) is sampled and transferred to the output (Q) on the rising or falling edge of the clock signal, depending on whether it's a positive-edge-triggered or negative-edge-triggered flip-flop.
   - On the rising edge of the clock, the value of the D input is transferred to the output. The output remains stable until the next rising edge of the clock.
   - This type of flip-flop is useful for applications where data needs to be latched or stored at specific clock intervals.

2. **JK Flip-Flop**:
   - A JK flip-flop has two control inputs: J (set) and K (reset), in addition to the clock input. The output of a JK flip-flop changes state on the clock edge only if the J and K inputs are both high.
   - The clock signal determines when the flip-flop reads the J and K inputs. The output changes state based on the inputs and the current state of the flip-flop on the rising or falling edge of the clock.
   - JK flip-flops are versatile and can be used for toggling, frequency division, and various other sequential logic operations.

3. **T Flip-Flop**:
   - A T flip-flop (Toggle flip-flop) toggles its output state whenever the clock signal transitions from one state to another (e.g., from low to high or high to low), provided the T input is high.
   - When the clock transitions occur and the T input is high, the output switches to its complemented state (i.e., if the output was high, it becomes low, and vice versa).
   - T flip-flops are often used in applications where a single signal needs to alternate between two states at each clock pulse, such as in frequency division circuits.

Each type of flip-flop utilizes the clock signal in a specific manner to control the timing of data transfer and state changes, allowing for various functionalities in digital circuits.
### Types
#### In simple language

1. **SR Flip-Flop (Set-Reset Flip-Flop):**
   - Think of an SR flip-flop like a simple light switch with two buttons: "Set" (S) and "Reset" (R).
   - When you press the "Set" button, the flip-flop turns on (1). It stays on until you press the "Reset" button, which turns it off (0).
   - If both buttons are pressed at the same time, it might cause confusion, and the flip-flop may end up in an unpredictable state.

2. **JK Flip-Flop:**
   - A JK flip-flop is like an SR flip-flop but with a bit more intelligence. It has two inputs: J and K.
   - It behaves somewhat like the SR flip-flop, but it has an additional feature: toggling.
   - If you press the "J" button, it sets the flip-flop (turns it on). If you press the "K" button, it resets the flip-flop (turns it off).
   - But if you press both "J" and "K" simultaneously, the flip-flop toggles its state. So, if it was off, it turns on, and if it was on, it turns off.

3. **D Flip-Flop (Data Flip-Flop):**
   - The D flip-flop is the simplest one. It's like having a single button labeled "D" for data.
   - When you press the "D" button, the flip-flop remembers that state until the next time you press it.
   - It's like a light switch that you flip once to turn on and flip again to turn off. The flip-flop keeps the last state you set until you change it.

4. **T Flip-Flop (Toggle Flip-Flop):**
   - The T flip-flop is like a button labeled "T" for toggle.
   - Each time you press the "T" button, it toggles the state of the flip-flop. So, if it was off, it turns on, and if it was on, it turns off.
   - It's like a light switch that changes its state every time you flick it, regardless of its previous state.

These flip-flops are fundamental building blocks in digital circuits, used for storing and manipulating binary data. They're like switches but with added intelligence to remember and control their state based on specific input signals.
#### SR Flip Flop
- SET RESET flip flop is designed with help of two NAND gate or two NOR gate. these are also called SR Latch
- The operation of the SR flip-flop is as follows. If there is no signal at the clock input C, the output of the circuit cannot change irrespective of the values at inputs S and R. Only when the clock signal changes from 0 to 1 can the output be affected according to the values in inputs S and R. If S = 1 and R = 0 when C changes from 0 to 1, output Q is cleared to 0. If both S and R are 0 during the clock transition, the output does not change. When both S and R are equal to 1, the output is unpredictable and may go to either 0 or 1, depending on internal timing delays that occur within the circuit

![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240303074700.png)
here t+1 represent Present output and t is past output
The SR flip-flop should not be pulsed when S = R = 1 since it produces an indeterminate next state. This indeterminate condition makes the SR flip-flop difficult to manage and therefore it is seldom used in practice.

#### D Flip Flop
The D (data) flip-flop is a slight modification of the SR flip-flop. An SR flip-flop is converted to a D flip-flop by inserting an inverter between S and R and assigning the symbol D to the single input. The D input is sampled during the occurrence of a clock transition from 0 to 1. If D = 1, the output of the flip-flop goes to the 1 state, but if D = 0, the output of the flip-flop goes to the 0 state.
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240303075425.png)

Characteristic equation:- Q(t + 1) = D

#### JK Flip Flop
A JK flip-flop is a refinement of the SR flip-flop in that the indeterminate condition of the SR type is defined in the JK type. Inputs J and K behave like inputs S and R to set and clear the flip-flop, respectively. When inputs J and K are both equal to 1, a clock transition switches the outputs of the flip-flop to their complement state
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240303075746.png)

#### T Flip Flop
Another type of flip-flop found in textbooks is the T (toggle) flip-flop. This flip-flop, shown in Figure 4-5, is obtained from a JK type when inputs J and K are connected to provide a single input designated by T. The T flip-flop therefore has only two conditions.
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240303080005.png)

### Excitation table
The characteristic tables of flip-flops specify the next state when the inputs and the present state are known. During the design of sequential circuits we usually know the required transition from present state to next state and wish to find the flip-flop inpu-t conditions that will cause the required transition. For this reason we need a table that lists the required input combinations for a given change of state. Such a table is called a flipflop excitation table.

## Registers
- Flip flop is 1-bit memory cell
- To increase the storage capacity . we have to use group of flip flop . this group of FF is known as registers
- N-bit of register consists of n number of flip flop and is capable of storing n-bit of word
### Types of registers
Registers are digital circuits used in computer systems for storing binary data temporarily. They come in various types, each designed for specific functions or applications. Here are some common types of registers:

1. **Data Register (D-Register):**
   - A data register stores data temporarily during processing. It can hold a single binary value or a group of binary values.
   - Data registers are used in arithmetic and logic operations, data movement, and other general-purpose tasks within a computer's central processing unit (CPU) or other parts of the system.

2. **Address Register:**
   - An address register holds memory addresses. It is used for accessing specific locations in memory or other storage devices.
   - Address registers are essential for memory management and addressing modes in computer architecture.

3. **Program Counter (PC):**
   - The program counter register stores the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched and executed in a program.
   - It is incremented after each instruction fetch, effectively pointing to the next instruction in the program sequence.
   - The program counter is crucial for controlling the program flow during execution.

4. **Instruction Register (IR):**
   - The instruction register holds the currently fetched instruction from memory during the instruction execution cycle.
   - It temporarily stores the opcode and operands of the instruction being executed by the CPU.
   - The instruction register is used for decoding and executing instructions in the CPU.

5. **Index Register:**
   - An index register is used for indexed addressing in memory access operations.
   - It holds an offset value that is added to a base address to calculate the effective memory address.
   - Index registers are commonly used in array processing and data structures.

6. **Stack Pointer (SP):**
   - The stack pointer register holds the memory address of the top of the stack in a stack-based memory organization.
   - It is used for pushing data onto the stack and popping data from the stack during subroutine calls and context switching.

7. **Flag Register:**
   - A flag register, also known as a status register, stores various status flags that indicate the outcome of arithmetic and logic operations.
   - Common flags include zero flag, carry flag, sign flag, overflow flag, and parity flag.
   - Flag registers are used for conditional branching and decision-making in program execution.

These are just a few examples of the types of registers commonly found in computer systems. Depending on the architecture and design of the system, there may be additional types of registers with specialized functions.

### Shift registers

A register capable of shifting its binary information in one or both directions is called a shift register. The logical configuration of a shift register consists of a chain of flip-flops in cascade, with the output of one flip-flop connected to the input of the next flip-flop. All flip-flops receive common clock pulses that initiate the shift from one stage to the next.

D flip flop used here commonly 

These are used to perform arithmetic operation

There are several types of shift registers:

1. **Serial-in, Serial-out (SISO) Shift Register:**
   - In a Serial-in, Serial-out shift register, data is inputted serially (one bit at a time) and shifted through the register, appearing one bit at a time at the output.
   - This type of shift register is often used for serial data communication and conversion between serial and parallel data formats.

2. **Serial-in, Parallel-out (SIPO) Shift Register:**
   - In a Serial-in, Parallel-out shift register, data is inputted serially and shifted through the register, but the output is available in parallel at the register's outputs.
   - This type of shift register is useful for converting serial data to parallel data, often used in interfacing with parallel devices or systems.

3. **Parallel-in, Serial-out (PISO) Shift Register:**
   - In a Parallel-in, Serial-out shift register, data is inputted in parallel (multiple bits simultaneously) and then shifted out serially.
   - This type of shift register is commonly used for parallel-to-serial data conversion.

4. **Parallel-in, Parallel-out (PIPO) Shift Register:**
   - In a Parallel-in, Parallel-out shift register, data is inputted and outputted in parallel, without any shifting operation.
   - It's useful for temporary storage of parallel data.

![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240303083943.png)

Shift registers are versatile and find applications in various areas, including:
- Serial data communication: Used in serial communication protocols such as SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) and UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter).
- Serial-to-parallel and parallel-to-serial conversion: Converting data between serial and parallel formats for interfacing with different types of devices.
- Data storage and manipulation: Temporary storage and manipulation of data within digital systems.

Shift registers are fundamental building blocks in digital circuits and are widely used in both hardware and software implementations for various applications.

## Counter 
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240519072958.png)

A register that goes through a predetermined sequence of states upon the application of input pulses is called a counter. The input pulses may be clock pulses or may originate form an external source. They may occur at uniform intervals of time or at random. Counters are found in almost all equipment containing digital logic. They are used for counting the number of occurrences of an event and are useful for generating timing signals to control the sequence of operations in digital computers.

A counter that follows the binary number sequence is called a binary counter. An n-bit binary counter is a register of n flip-flops and associated gates that follows a sequence of states according to the binary count of n bits, from 0 to 2n â€“ 1.

Finding mode value of counter :- just count the different states
To find number of filp flops (n) required to design counter having mode value m :- 2<sup>n</sup> >= m

### Sync vs Async counter

| Feature                    | Synchronous Counter                                                       | Asynchronous Counter                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Clocking                   | All flip-flops are clocked by the same common clock signal.               | Flip-flops are clocked by individual or separate clock signals.                |

# Basic Computer organisation and Design 
a "word" typically refers to a basic unit of data that a computer's central processing unit (CPU) can process or manipulate in a single operation. The size of a word is determined by the architecture of the CPU and often corresponds to the width of the CPU's internal data bus.

## Operation and microoperation
In the context of computer architecture and digital systems:

1. **Operation:**
   - An operation refers to a high-level task or action that a computer performs. It represents a meaningful task that contributes to the execution of a program or instruction.
   - Examples of operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, logical operations (AND, OR, NOT), data movement (loading, storing), comparison, branching (jumping to a different instruction based on a condition), and many more.
   - In programming, operations are specified through instructions, which are encoded commands that tell the computer's central processing unit (CPU) what to do.

2. **Microoperation:**
   - A microoperation, on the other hand, represents a small, low-level operation or action performed by the hardware components within a CPU to execute an instruction.
   - Microoperations are the basic building blocks of instruction execution and are typically implemented as simple operations on data within the CPU's registers and other internal components.
   - These operations are usually very elementary, such as loading data from a register, performing arithmetic or logic operations on data, storing data into a register, shifting bits, incrementing or decrementing a value, and transferring control signals within the CPU.
   - Each instruction executed by the CPU typically involves a sequence of microoperations that collectively achieve the desired high-level operation specified by the instruction.

## Stored Program organisation
The simplest way to organize a computer is to have one processor register and instruction code format with two parts. The first part specifies the operation to be performed and the second specifies an address. The memory address tells the control where to find an operand in memory. This operand is read from memory and used as the data to be operated on together with the data stored in the processor register.

opcode(operation code)
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240303150418.png)
 Instructions are stored in one section of memory and data in another. For a memory unit with 4096 words we need 12 bits to specify an address since 2<sup>12</sup> = 4096. If we store each instruction code in one 16-bit memory word, we have available four bits for the operation code (abbreviated op code) to specify one out of 16 possible operations, and 12 bits to specify the address of an operand. 
 
 The control reads a 16-bit instruction from the program portion of memory. It uses the 12-bit address part of the instruction to read a 16-bit operand from the data portion of memory. It then executes the operation specified by the operation code.

## Register
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240303151650.png)

## Instruction code
- Group of bits that tells computer what to do basically
- contains two thing :- opcode(operation code like ADD , SUB) and address(address of operand on which operation will be performed);

### Types of Instruction
- Memory reference instructions:- Memory reference instructions are those that involve operations which read from or write to the memory. They typically involve specifying a memory address from which data is to be read or to which data is to be written.
- Register reference instructions:- Register reference instructions perform operations directly on the processor's registers. These operations include data transfer, arithmetic, logical operations, and control instructions that do not involve memory access.
- Input output Instruction:- I/O reference instructions enable the CPU to send data to and receive data from I/O devices. They are essential for handling external communications and managing device operations

# CPU
## Intro
The CPU is made up of three major parts, as shown in Figure 6-1. The register set stores intermediate data used during the execution of the instructions. The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) performs the required microoperations for executing the instructions. The control unit supervises the transfer of information among the registers and instructs the ALU as to which operation to perform.

## Types of CPU Organisation
Single Accumulator Organization:
In a single accumulator organization, there is a single central accumulator register that is used for arithmetic and logical operations. All operations are performed between the accumulator and another operand, typically fetched from memory or another register. After performing an operation, the result is stored back in the accumulator. This organization simplifies the CPU design and instruction set but may require more memory accesses for certain operations.

General Register Organization:
In a general register organization, the CPU has multiple general-purpose registers that can hold data and addresses. These registers are used for storing operands, intermediate results, and memory addresses during program execution. General register organization allows for faster execution of instructions as operands can be accessed directly from registers, reducing the need for memory accesses. It also enables more flexible and efficient programming but may require a more complex CPU design.

Stack Organization:
In stack organization, a stack data structure is used to store data and addresses. The stack grows and shrinks dynamically as data is pushed onto or popped off the stack. The CPU typically includes a special-purpose register called the stack pointer (SP) that points to the top of the stack. Operations such as push and pop are used to add data to and remove data from the stack, respectively. Stack organization is commonly used for function calls, parameter passing, local variable storage, and managing program execution flow. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage data storage and retrieval but may require careful management to avoid stack overflow or underflow.

MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second) and MFLOPS (Million Floating Point Operations Per Second) are both metrics used to measure the performance of a computer processor, but they focus on different aspects of computation. Here's a breakdown of the differences between them:

### MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)
1. **Definition**: MIPS measures the number of instructions a processor can execute in one second.
2. **Focus**: It counts the execution rate of all types of instructions, including integer and control instructions, not just floating-point operations.
3. **Usage**: MIPS is often used to indicate the general speed of a processor in performing basic operations.
4. **Advantages**:
   - Simple to understand and calculate.
   - Useful for comparing the performance of processors within the same architecture.
5. **Limitations**:I/O reference instructions enable the CPU to send data to and receive data from I/O devices. They are essential for handling external communications and managing device operations
   - Does not account for the complexity or variability of instructions (some instructions may take more cycles to execute than others).
   - Can be misleading when comparing different architectures because different instruction sets may have different complexities.
   - Ignores the impact of memory latency, I/O operations, and other factors that affect real-world performance.

### MFLOPS (Million Floating Point Operations Per Second)
1. **Definition**: MFLOPS measures the number of floating-point operations a processor can perform in one second.
2. **Focus**: Specifically targets floating-point operations, which are critical in scientific, engineering, and graphics computations.
3. **Usage**: MFLOPS is particularly relevant in fields requiring heavy mathematical computations, like scientific simulations, 3D graphics, and computational physics.
4. **Advantages**:
   - Provides a clearer picture of a processor's ability to handle floating-point intensive tasks.
   - More relevant than MIPS for applications involving complex numerical calculations.
5. **Limitations**:
   - Like MIPS, it may not reflect real-world performance accurately since it doesn't consider memory bottlenecks or other system components.
   - Specific to floating-point operations, so it doesnâ€™t give a comprehensive view of general processor performance.

### Address sequencing
Address sequencing is a fundamental concept in computer architecture, particularly in the context of instruction execution, memory access, and control unit design. It involves determining the sequence of addresses that the CPU needs to access during program execution. Here are detailed notes on address sequencing:

### Definition
Address sequencing refers to the process of generating the sequence of memory addresses that the CPU accesses while executing instructions. This involves fetching instructions, accessing operands, and storing results in a coordinated manner.

### Key Concepts
1. **Program Counter (PC)**:
   - A special register that holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.
   - It increments after fetching an instruction to point to the subsequent instruction in the sequence.

2. **Instruction Sequencing**:
   - The process of determining the next instruction to execute, which can be sequential or involve jumps/branches based on control flow instructions.
   - Sequential execution: The next instruction is at the next memory address (PC + 1).
   - Branching: The next instruction address is determined by the instruction itself (e.g., jump or branch instructions).

3. **Addressing Modes**:
   - Various modes determine how the effective address of an operand is calculated.
   - Common modes include immediate, direct, indirect, indexed, and register addressing.

### Mechanisms of Address Sequencing
1. **Sequential Addressing**:
   - Instructions are fetched from consecutive memory locations.
   - The PC increments by a fixed amount (typically the instruction length) after each fetch.

2. **Branching and Jumping**:
   - Control instructions modify the PC based on certain conditions or unconditionally.
   - Examples include `JMP` (unconditional jump), `BEQ` (branch if equal), `BNE` (branch if not equal).

3. **Subroutine Calls and Returns**:
   - Subroutine calls involve jumping to a different part of the program and storing the return address.
   - The return instruction fetches the address from a stack or a register to resume execution after the subroutine.

4. **Interrupts and Exceptions**:
   - External or internal events can alter the normal sequencing of instructions.
   - The CPU jumps to an interrupt service routine (ISR) address, and after handling the interrupt, returns to the original sequence.

### Importance in Computer Architecture
Address sequencing is critical for:
- **Correct Program Execution**: Ensures that instructions are fetched and executed in the correct order.
- **Control Flow Management**: Handles branches, loops, function calls, and interrupts efficiently.
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient sequencing can reduce delays and improve instruction throughput.
- **Flexibility and Scalability**: Proper sequencing mechanisms support complex instruction sets and advanced CPU features.

![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240413172207.png)

### Type of access mode
1. **Sequential Access**: In this mode, data is accessed in a sequential order, meaning one after the other in a sequence. Imagine a list of items stored in a file or on a tape. To access data, you have to start from the beginning and read through the data sequentially until you find the desired piece. It's like reading a book from start to finish without skipping pages. Sequential access is often slower compared to random access, especially when you need to access data that is located far from the current position because you have to read through all the preceding data.

2. **Random Access**: In contrast to sequential access, random access allows you to access any piece of data directly without having to read through the preceding data. Think of it as jumping to a specific page in a book without having to flip through the pages sequentially. Random access is faster for accessing individual pieces of data, but the speed doesn't depend on the location of the data within the storage medium.

3. **Direct Access**: Also known as indexed access or relative access, direct access combines aspects of both sequential and random access. It allows accessing any piece of data directly like random access, but the way to access the data is determined by an index or key value, similar to how you'd look up a word in a dictionary. This mode is efficient for accessing specific data items without having to read through the entire dataset sequentially. Direct access is commonly used in databases where data is organized and accessed using indexes.

cpu address divided into (tag , index)
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240519203736.png)
### Direct Mapping

**Concept:**
- Direct mapping maps each block of main memory to a specific cache line.
- The cache is divided into multiple lines, each of which can store one block of data from main memory.
- The mapping is determined by a simple modulo operation on the block address.

**Mechanism:**
- **Address Division:** A memory address is divided into three parts:
  - **Tag:** Identifies the block.
  - **Index:** Identifies the specific cache line.
  - **Block Offset:** Identifies the specific data within the block.
- **Mapping Function:** The index part of the address determines the cache line where the block will be stored. For example, if the cache has \(N\) lines, the block address \(A\) will be stored in cache line \(A \mod N\).

**Advantages:**
- Simple implementation.
- Low cost due to simpler hardware requirements.

**Disadvantages:**
- Potential for high conflict misses: If multiple blocks map to the same cache line, they will continuously overwrite each other, leading to frequent cache misses.
- Limited flexibility in data placement.

### Associative Mapping (Fully Associative Mapping)

**Concept:**
- In associative mapping, any block of main memory can be loaded into any line of the cache.
- There are no fixed positions for a particular block; it can be stored anywhere in the cache.

**Mechanism:**
- **Address Division:** A memory address is divided into two parts:
  - **Tag:** Identifies the block.
  - **Block Offset:** Identifies the specific data within the block.
- **Mapping Function:** The cache controller searches the entire cache to find a block with a matching tag. This allows any block to be placed in any cache line.

**Advantages:**
- Minimizes conflict misses: Since any block can be placed in any cache line, the chance of overwriting a frequently used block is reduced.
- Increased flexibility in data placement.

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher complexity and cost: Requires more complex hardware for searching the entire cache.
- Longer access times compared to direct mapping, due to the need to search all lines.

### Comparison Summary

| Feature                  | Direct Mapping                | Associative Mapping             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Flexibility**          | Fixed position for each block | Any block can go into any line  |
| **Complexity**           | Simple, low-cost              | Complex, higher-cost            |
| **Conflict Misses**      | High potential                | Low potential                   |
| **Access Time**          | Faster due to simple lookup   | Slower due to full cache search |
| **Hardware Requirement** | Less complex                  | More complex                    |

# UNIT 3

## Instruction set based processor classification (RISC and CISC)
An instruction set is a collection of instructions that a processor can execute. These instructions define the operations that the processor can perform, such as arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), data movement (loading data from memory, storing data to memory), control flow (branching, jumping), and various other tasks.


### types based on Instruction set
- CISC
- RISC
- VLIW(Very long instruction word) processors execute multiple operations in a single long instruction word, allowing parallel execution of operations.

### CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)
CISC architecture aims to complete tasks in as few lines of assembly as possible. The key characteristics of CISC include:

1. **Complex Instructions**: CISC processors have a large set of instructions, some of which can execute complex tasks in a single instruction.
2. **Microprogrammed Control Units**: These control units can decode and execute complex instructions, potentially involving multiple steps.
3. **Variable-Length Instruction Format**: Instructions can vary in length, which can lead to more efficient use of memory.
4. **Fewer Registers**: Typically, CISC processors use fewer general-purpose registers since many operations can be performed directly in memory.
5. **Higher Cycles per Instruction (CPI)**: Because of their complexity, individual instructions can take multiple clock cycles to execute.

Examples of CISC processors include the x86 architecture used in many personal computers.

### RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)
RISC architecture focuses on a small, highly optimized set of instructions that are designed to be executed very quickly. The key characteristics of RISC include:

1. **Simple Instructions**: RISC processors have a limited set of simple instructions that can be executed in a single clock cycle.
2. **Hardwired Control Units**: These control units are designed for fast instruction execution.
3. **Fixed-Length Instruction Format**: Instructions are usually of a fixed length, which simplifies the design of the instruction pipeline and increases execution speed.
4. **More Registers**: RISC processors typically have a larger number of general-purpose registers to minimize memory access.
5. **Lower Cycles per Instruction (CPI)**: Instructions are designed to be executed in fewer cycles, often just one.

Examples of RISC processors include the ARM architecture commonly used in smartphones and embedded systems.

![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240425212033.png)
### Goals of parallelism
#### Throuput enhancement
Throughput refers to the rate at which a system can process and complete tasks or transactions within a given period of time. It is a measure of the system's efficiency in handling workloads and is often expressed in terms of tasks completed per unit of time (e.g., transactions per second, instructions per cycle).

Enhancing throughput involves improving the system's ability to process tasks more quickly and efficiently. Here are some techniques commonly used to enhance throughput:

1. **Parallelism**: Parallelism involves executing multiple tasks simultaneously to increase overall throughput. This can be achieved at various levels, including task-level parallelism (executing independent tasks concurrently), data-level parallelism (processing multiple data elements simultaneously), and instruction-level parallelism (simultaneously executing multiple instructions within a single processor core).

2. **Pipeline Processing**: Pipeline processing divides a task into a series of stages, with each stage performing a specific operation. By overlapping the execution of multiple tasks in different stages of the pipeline, throughput can be increased. Pipeline processing is commonly used in processors, where instructions are executed in multiple stages (instruction fetch, decode, execute, etc.).

3. **Caching**: Caching involves storing frequently accessed data or instructions in fast-access memory locations (caches) closer to the processing units. By reducing the time required to access data from slower memory, caching improves overall system throughput.

4. **Prefetching**: Prefetching anticipates future memory accesses and retrieves data in advance, placing it in caches before it is actually needed. This helps to reduce memory access latency and improve overall throughput by ensuring that data is readily available when required.

5. **Concurrency Control**: In systems with multiple users or processes accessing shared resources, concurrency control techniques such as locking, synchronization, and transaction management are used to ensure efficient utilization of resources and prevent contention, which can degrade throughput.

6. **Load Balancing**: Load balancing distributes tasks evenly across processing units or resources to ensure that no single component becomes a bottleneck. By optimizing resource utilization and minimizing idle time, load balancing improves overall system throughput.

## Concurrency 
Concurrency and parallelism are concepts related to executing multiple tasks or processes, but they refer to different approaches and have distinct meanings:

### Concurrency

**Concurrency** is the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at the same time, but not necessarily simultaneously. It focuses on the management of multiple tasks, ensuring that they progress without interfering with each other. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.

#### Key Points about Concurrency:
1. **Task Switching**: Concurrency involves switching between tasks to give the appearance of simultaneous execution.
2. **Resource Sharing**: Multiple tasks share the same resources (e.g., CPU, memory) and coordinate their execution to avoid conflicts.
3. **Decomposition**: A single task or process is broken into smaller sub-tasks that can be interleaved.
4. **Examples**: Running multiple threads in a single-core processor, handling multiple user requests in a web server.

### Parallelism

**Parallelism** involves performing multiple tasks or computations simultaneously. It requires multiple processors or cores and is about doing lots of things at the same time.

#### Key Points about Parallelism:
1. **Simultaneous Execution**: Parallelism executes multiple tasks or sub-tasks at the same time on different processors or cores.
2. **Independent Tasks**: Tasks are often independent of each other, allowing them to run without waiting for other tasks to complete.
3. **Speedup**: The goal is to reduce the time required to complete a task by dividing it into smaller parts and executing them in parallel.
4. **Examples**: Processing large datasets in parallel using multiple cores (e.g., in data analysis), running multiple independent simulations on different CPUs.

### Differences Between Concurrency and Parallelism

1. **Execution Model**:
   - **Concurrency**: Tasks make progress concurrently (interleaved execution), often on a single processor by time-slicing.
   - **Parallelism**: Tasks run in parallel (simultaneous execution) on multiple processors or cores.

2. **Purpose**:
   - **Concurrency**: To improve the responsiveness of a system by managing multiple tasks.
   - **Parallelism**: To improve the throughput and computational efficiency by dividing tasks across multiple processors.

3. **Resource Usage**:
   - **Concurrency**: Focuses on efficient use of a single processor by switching between tasks.
   - **Parallelism**: Utilizes multiple processors to perform computations simultaneously.

4. **Implementation**:
   - **Concurrency**: Achieved through techniques like threading, coroutines, and asynchronous programming.
   - **Parallelism**: Achieved through multiprocessing, multi-core processing, and distributed computing.

### Examples to Illustrate the Difference

- **Concurrency Example**: 
  - Imagine a single cook (CPU) preparing multiple dishes (tasks) by switching between them. The cook might chop vegetables for one dish, then stir a pot for another, ensuring that all dishes progress concurrently but not simultaneously.
  
- **Parallelism Example**: 
  - Imagine multiple cooks (CPUs) in a kitchen, each preparing a different dish at the same time. Each cook works independently on their dish, resulting in simultaneous preparation of multiple dishes.

### Combining Concurrency and Parallelism

Many modern systems and applications combine concurrency and parallelism to optimize performance and responsiveness. For example, a web server might handle multiple client requests concurrently using threads (concurrency), while also processing large data computations in parallel using multiple cores (parallelism).

### Summary

- **Concurrency**: Managing multiple tasks simultaneously by interleaving their execution, often on a single processor.
- **Parallelism**: Performing multiple tasks simultaneously using multiple processors or cores.
- **Key Difference**: Concurrency is about task management and responsiveness, while parallelism is about execution speed and throughput.
## Instruction level parallelism 
Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP) refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple instructions within a single processor core to improve performance. It aims to exploit opportunities for parallel execution at the instruction level, allowing multiple instructions to be processed concurrently instead of sequentially.

### Scaler Architecture
Scalar architecture refers to a type of computer architecture where each instruction operates on a single data item at a time. In scalar processors, instructions typically perform arithmetic, logic, or data movement operations on individual data elements, one at a time. This contrasts with vector architectures, where instructions can operate on multiple data elements simultaneously.

Key characteristics of scalar architecture include:

1. **Single Data Stream**: Scalar processors process one data element at a time. Instructions operate on scalar values, which are individual data items (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers) rather than arrays or vectors of data.

2. **Sequential Execution**: Instructions are executed sequentially, with each instruction completing before the next one begins. There is no inherent parallelism at the instruction level within a single processor core.

3. **Limited Parallelism**: While scalar processors may include multiple execution units capable of performing different types of operations (e.g., arithmetic, logic), instructions are typically executed one at a time in program order.

4. **Instruction Pipelining**: Scalar processors often employ instruction pipelining to improve performance by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions. However, each instruction progresses through the pipeline stages independently, and there is no simultaneous execution of multiple instructions.

### Super scaler
1. A superscalar processor is one in which multiple independent instruction pipelines are used. Each pipeline consists of multiple stages, so that each pipeline can handle multiple instructions at a time.
2. **Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP)**: The primary goal of superscalar architectures is to exploit ILP, which involves identifying and executing independent instructions in parallel to improve overall performance. This is done by analyzing the instruction stream to identify dependencies and scheduling instructions for concurrent execution whenever possible.
3. **Dynamic Instruction Scheduling**: Superscalar processors typically employ dynamic instruction scheduling techniques to identify and exploit parallelism at runtime. Instructions are dispatched to execution units dynamically, based on availability of resources and data dependencies.
4. **Out-of-Order Execution**: Superscalar processors often support out-of-order execution, where instructions are executed as soon as their operands are available, rather than strictly following program order. This allows the processor to overlap the execution of independent instructions and maximize resource utilization.

here each time 2 instruction is execution and when a single stage of these instruction is completed new two instructions are taken for execution

#### Components of Super scaler
- Instruction Fetch unit :- Responsible for fetching instructions from memory and placing them in the instruction queue for decoding 
- Instruction Decode Unit:- Decodes Instructions fetched from memory and identifies the necessary resource and execution units required for their execution
- Reservation Stations:- These are buffers that holds decoded instruction along with their operands until all dependencies are resolved ,and execution resources become available
- Execution Units:- These unit perform actual computation or data manipulation operations, such as arithmetic ,logic operation
- Recorder buffer :- A buffer that ensures in order retirement of instruction , even if they were executed out of order. These amaintain sequential consistency
#### Feature of super scalar 
- Instruction level parallel
- Single processor
- RISC Processor
- Instructions should be independent
- Multiple pipeline 
- Multiple instruction are executed per clock cycle

## Processor level parallelism 
A multiprocessor system is an interconnection of two or more CPUs with memory and inputâ€”output equipment. The term "processor" in multiprocessor can mean either a central processing unit (CPU) or an input-output processor (IOP). 

there are several physical forms available for establishing an interconnection network.
Some of these schemes are presented in this section:
1. Time-shared common bus
2. Multiport memory
3. Crossbar switch
4. Multistage switching network
5. Hypercube system
