# Digital logical Gates
## Some Definations
- Signals:- these are physical quantities which vary over time
- Binary logic deals with binary variables and with operations that assume a logical meaning. It is used to describe, in algebraic or tabular form, the manipulation and processing of binary information. 
- The manipulation of binary information is done by logic circuits called gates. Gates are blocks of hardware that produce signals of binary 1 or 0 when input logic requirements are satisfied.
## Digital vs Analog signal
Digital and analog signals are two different types of signals used to represent and transmit information in various electronic systems. Here's a breakdown of their differences and the benefits of one over the other:

**Digital Signals:**
1. **Representation**: Digital signals represent information using discrete values, typically binary (0s and 1s). Each value is called a bit. Digital signals are represented as sequences of these discrete values.
2. **Accuracy**: Digital signals are less susceptible to noise and interference compared to analog signals. They can be transmitted over longer distances without significant loss of quality.
3. **Processing**: Digital signals can be easily processed, manipulated, and analyzed using digital circuits and algorithms. They allow for precise control and manipulation of information.
4. **Storage**: Digital signals can be stored and reproduced without degradation. This makes digital storage mediums (such as hard drives, flash drives, and optical discs) reliable for long-term storage of data.
5. **Compression**: Digital signals can be compressed efficiently, allowing for the storage and transmission of large amounts of information in a compact form. This is essential for multimedia applications such as audio and video streaming.

**Analog Signals:**
1. **Representation**: Analog signals represent information using continuous values that vary over time. These values can be any real number within a certain range. Examples include voltage, current, and frequency.
2. **Resolution**: Analog signals have infinite resolution, meaning they can represent an infinite number of values within their range. This allows for smooth and continuous representation of information.
3. **Natural Representation**: Many real-world phenomena, such as sound, light, and temperature, are inherently analog in nature. Analog signals provide a natural representation of these phenomena without the need for conversion.
4. **Sensitivity**: Analog signals can capture subtle variations in input signals with high sensitivity, making them suitable for applications where fine details need to be preserved.

**Benefits of Digital over Analog:**
1. **Noise Immunity**: Digital signals are less susceptible to noise and interference, making them more reliable in noisy environments.
2. **Ease of Processing**: Digital signals can be easily processed, manipulated, and analyzed using digital circuits and algorithms, allowing for complex operations and functions.
3. **Storage and Reproduction**: Digital signals can be stored and reproduced without degradation, making them suitable for long-term storage and transmission.
4. **Compression**: Digital signals can be compressed efficiently, allowing for the storage and transmission of large amounts of information in a compact form.
**Benefits of Analog over Digital:**
1. **Resolution**: Analog signals have infinite resolution, allowing for smooth and continuous representation of information without quantization effects.
2. **Natural Representation**: Analog signals provide a natural representation of many real-world phenomena without the need for conversion, preserving the fidelity of the original information.
3. **Sensitivity**: Analog signals can capture subtle variations in input signals with high sensitivity, making them suitable for applications where fine details need to be preserved, such as in audio and video recording.
In summary, the choice between digital and analog signals depends on the specific requirements of the application. While digital signals offer advantages in terms of noise immunity, processing capabilities, and storage efficiency, analog signals excel in providing high resolution, natural representation, and sensitivity to subtle variations in input signals.

## Basic Digital circuit
### What is it 
A digital circuit is a circuit that operates using digital signals, which are discrete signals represented by binary numbers (0s and 1s). These circuits are designed to process, store, and transmit digital information using a combination of logic gates and other digital components.

Digital circuits are built from electronic components such as transistors, diodes, resistors, and capacitors. These components are interconnected to form logic gates, flip-flops, registers, counters, and other digital elements. The behavior of digital circuits is determined by the logical operations performed on binary inputs to produce binary outputs.

In a digital system there are only a few basic operations performed, irrespective of the complexities of the system.  The basic operations are AND, OR, NOT, and FLIP-FLOP(which is a basic memory element used to store binary information (one bit is stored in one FLIP-FLOP)).

**An integrated circuit (IC) is a small semiconductor chip that contains electronic components such as transistors, diodes, resistors, and capacitors, as well as interconnections between them, all fabricated onto a single piece of semiconductor material. Integrated circuits are also commonly referred to as microchips or simply chips.**
### Combinational vs Sequential circuit 
Combinational and sequential circuits are two fundamental types of digital circuits, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

**Combinational Circuits:**

1. **Definition**: Combinational circuits produce outputs solely based on the current input values, without any memory or feedback. The outputs are determined by the logical combination of the input signals.

2. **Behavior**: The outputs of a combinational circuit are purely a function of the current input values. There is no notion of time dependency or sequential behavior. These circuits are essentially "stateless" in that they do not have memory elements to retain information.

3. **Examples**: Combinational circuits include logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.), multiplexers, demultiplexers, decoders, encoders, and adders.

4. **Applications**: Combinational circuits are used for tasks such as logical operations, arithmetic operations, data routing, data conversion, and encoding/decoding. They are suitable for applications where the output depends solely on the current input values and there is no need for memory or sequential behavior.

**Sequential Circuits:**

1. **Definition**: Sequential circuits contain memory elements (such as flip-flops or latches) that allow them to store information internally. The outputs of a sequential circuit depend not only on the current input values but also on the circuit's previous state.

2. **Behavior**: Sequential circuits exhibit time dependency and sequential behavior. The outputs are determined by the current input values as well as the circuit's internal state, which is influenced by past inputs and outputs.

3. **Examples**: Sequential circuits include flip-flops, registers, counters, shift registers, finite state machines (FSMs), and memory units.

4. **Applications**: Sequential circuits are used in applications where past history or sequential behavior is important, such as in digital clocks, microprocessors, memory units, control systems, and communication protocols. They are capable of storing and processing data over time, making them essential for tasks requiring memory or sequential logic.

In summary, combinational circuits produce outputs solely based on the current input values, without any memory, while sequential circuits incorporate memory elements to retain past information, resulting in outputs that depend on both current inputs and past states. Both types of circuits have unique characteristics and are used in various digital systems based on the specific requirements of the application.

These logical gates serve as the basic building blocks of digital circuits, allowing for the manipulation and processing of binary data in various electronic systems.

# Boolean algebra
The number of gates and the number of input terminals for the gates required for the realization of a
logical expression, in general, get reduced considerably if the expression can be simplified. Therefore, the simplification of logical expression is very important as it saves the hardware required to design a specific system
### Approaches to design combinational circuit
The two approaches to the design of combinational circuits that you've described represent different methodologies for achieving the desired logic functionality. Let's explore each approach in more detail:

1. **Traditional Method**:
   - In the traditional method, the design process involves simplifying the given Boolean expression or truth table using standard methods such as Karnaugh maps, Boolean algebra, or Boolean simplification techniques.
   - Once the expression is simplified, it is implemented using basic logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR gates.
   - The simplified expression leads to a circuit design that typically consists of a combination of these basic logic gates interconnected to achieve the desired logic function.
   - This approach requires expertise in Boolean algebra and logic simplification techniques and often results in circuits with a minimal number of gates, making them efficient in terms of cost and space.
- The following methods can be used to simplify the Boolean function:
	1. Algebraic method,
	2. Karnaugh map technique,
	3. Variable entered aping (VEM) technique, and
	4. Quino-McCluskey method.
2. **Direct Use of Complex Logic Functions in MSI/LSI**:
   - In this approach, the design process skips the step of simplifying the logical expression or truth table. Instead, complex logic functions available in Medium Scale Integrated Circuits (MSI) or Large Scale Integrated Circuits (LSI) are directly utilized.
   - MSI and LSI components contain pre-designed, ready-to-use logic functions such as multiplexers, decoders, encoders, adders, subtractors, and comparators.
   - Designers select appropriate MSI or LSI components based on the required logic functions without necessarily simplifying the logic expression beforehand.
   - This approach can simplify the design process and reduce design time, as designers can leverage pre-designed and pre-optimized complex logic functions.
   - However, it may lead to less efficient use of resources compared to the traditional method, as the selected MSI or LSI components may include unnecessary logic elements or functionalities.

In summary, the traditional method involves simplifying the logical expression before implementation using basic logic gates, whereas the direct use of complex logic functions in MSI or LSI skips the simplification step and utilizes pre-designed logic functions directly. Both approaches have their advantages and drawbacks, and the choice between them depends on factors such as design complexity, resource constraints, and design goals.

### Boolean Algebra intro
Boolean algebra is a mathematical discipline that deals with the manipulation and analysis of logical expressions and functions.deals with binary values, where variables and expressions can take on only two possible values: true (often represented as 1 or "high") and false (often represented as 0 or "low").

# Combinational Circuit
## Design procedure of CC
The design procedure of a combinational circuits starts from the verbal outline of the
problem and ends in a logic circuit diagram. The procedure involves the following steps:
1. The problem is stated.
2. The input and output variables are assigned letter symbols.
3. The truth table that defines the relationship between inputs and outputs is derived.
4. The simplified Boolean functions for each output are obtained.
5. The logic diagram is drawn.

## Adder (Example of arithemetic circuit)
In many computers and other types of processors, adders are used to calculate addresses, similar operations and table indices in the ALU and also in other parts of the processors. 

### Types 
#### Half adder
A combinational circuit that performs the arithmetic addition of two bits is called a halfadder. One that performs the addition of three bits (two significant bits and a previous carry) is called a full-adder.
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302071058.png)
The input variables of a half-adder are called the augend and addend bits. The output variables the sum and carry
#### Full adder
A full adder is a combinational circuit used in digital electronics to perform addition of two binary numbers. Unlike a half adder, which can only add two single bits, a full adder can also take into account a carry bit from a previous addition operation, allowing it to add three bits: two bits from the numbers being added (typically denoted as x and y), and a carry-in bit (denoted as z).
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302071643.png)

## Subtractor 
Subtractor circuits take two binary numbers as input and subtract one binary number
input from the other binary number input. Similar to adders, it gives out two outputs,
difference and borrow (carry-in the case of Adder).
### Half subtractor 
Half subtractor is a combination circuit with two inputs and two outputs (difference and borrow). It produces the difference between the two binary bits at the input and also produces an output (Borrow) to indicate if a 1 has been borrowed. In the subtraction (AB), A is called as Minuend bit and B is called as Subtrahend bit.
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302071845.png)

### Full Subtractor
The disadvantage of a half subtractor is overcome by full subtractor. The full subtractor is a combinational circuit with three inputs A,B,C and two output D and C'. A is the 'minuend', B is 'subtrahend', C is the 'borrow' produced by the previous stage, D is the difference output and C' is the borrow output.
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302072009.png)

## Decoder
A decoder is a combinational circuit in digital electronics that takes binary-coded inputs and converts them into a corresponding set of output signals. Each unique combination of input bits corresponds to a specific output signal.
Used to convert binary to other codes :
1. Binary to octal
2. Binary to Hexa
3. Binary to Decimal

***The decoders presented in this section are called n-to-m-line decoders, where m â‰¤ 2n. Their purpose is to generate the 2n (or fewer) binary combinations of the n input variables. A decoder has n inputs and m outputs and is also referred to as an n x m decoder.***
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302075608.png)

here for each input combination  a single output line is active
### NAND Decoder
Some decoders are constructed with NAND instead of AND gates. Since a NAND gate produces the AND operation with an inverted output, it becomes more economical to generate the decoder outputs in their complement form. 

By using NAND gates, the need for separate inverters to generate output complements is eliminated. This simplifies the overall circuit design and reduces the number of components required, resulting in a more economical solution.
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302075544.png)

### Decoder expansion
There are occasions when a certain-size decoder is needed but only smaller sizes are available. When this occurs it is possible to combine two or more decoders with enable inputs to form a larger decoder
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302080727.png)

## Encoder
An encoder is a digital circuit that performs the inverse operation of the decoder. An encoder has 2n (or less) input lines and n output lines. The output lines generate the binary code corresponding to the input value
![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020240302080911.png)
## Multiplexer
It is a combinational circuit that has 2<sup>n</sup> input lines and single output line
it is a electronic switch that connect 1 out of n input to output
it is functionally complete , all boolean function can be realised using one multiplexer without any other gates
