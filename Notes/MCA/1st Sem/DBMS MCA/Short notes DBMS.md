## Unit 1st 
- Feature of DB
	- represent some aspect of real world (mini world)
	- logically coherent collection of data 
	- DB has an objective
	- Insulation b/w program and data 
	- Support of multiple views of data 
	- Sharing of data and multiuser
- +ves of DB
	- Data integrity and accuracy (like key constraints)
	- Data security(authorisation and access control)
	- Data consistency
	- Data independence
	- Concurrent access and multi user suppport
- -ve of DB
	- Complex and cost
	- Performance overhead (need of query optimisation , indexing)
	- Learning curve
	- Dependency on DBMS Vendor
- Designing DB
	- Requirement specification and analysis
	- Conceptual design
	- Logical design (can be expressed in a data model)
	- Physical design (specification for storing and accessing the database)
- Users
	- DBA
		- Authorisation and access control
		- Coordination and Monitiorting 
		- Resource management 
		- System performance enhancement
		- security breach and mitigation
	- End user
		- Casual (occasionally interact with a DB, limited to no techincal knowledge)
		- Naive (similar to causal  perform routine tasks, have slightly more familiarity with DB interface but lacks indepth knowledge)
		- sophisticated 
		- Standalone
- DB Arch
	- Tiers
		- 1: DBMS is the only entity where the user directly sits on the DBMS and uses it. Any changes done here will directly be done on the DBMS itself.
		- 2: it must have an application through which the DBMS can be accessed. Programmers use 2-tier architecture where they access the DBMS by means of an application. Here the application tier is entirely independent of the database in terms of operation, design, and programming.
		- 3: separates its tiers from each other based on the complexity of the users and how they use the data present in the database. It is the most widely used architecture to design a DBMS
			- Database(data) tier: database resides along with its query processing languages. We also have the relations that define the data and their constraints at this level.
			- Application (Middle) tier:- At this tier reside the application server and the programs that access the database. For a user, this application tier presents an abstracted view of the database. End-users are unaware of any existence of the database beyond the application. At the other end, the database tier is not aware of any other user beyond the application tier. Hence, the application layer sits in the middle and acts as a mediator between the end-user and the database.
			- User (Presentation) Tier − End-users operate on this tier and they know nothing about any existence of the database beyond this layer. At this layer, multiple views of the database can be provided by the application. All views are generated by applications that reside in the application tier
- Data Models:- Collection of concepts that can be used to describe database structure
	- +ves 
		- Ensures that all data objects required by the database are accurately represented. Omission of data will lead to creation of faulty reports and produce incorrect results.
		- A data model helps design the database at the conceptual, physical and logical levels.
		- Data Model structure helps to define the relational tables, primary and foreign keys and stored procedures.
		- It provides a clear picture of the base data and can be used by database developers to create a physical database.
		- It is also helpful to identify missing and redundant data.
		- Though the initial creation of data model is labor and time consuming, in the long run, it makes your IT infrastructure upgrade and maintenance cheaper and faster.
	- types
		- Conceptual or Object Data Model: This Data Model defines WHAT the system contains. This model is typically created by Business stakeholders and Data Architects. The purpose is to organize, scope and define business concepts and rules.
		- Logical Data Model: Defines HOW the system should be implemented regardless of the DBMS. This model is typically created by Data Architects and Business Analysts. The purpose is to developed technical map of rules and data structures.
		- Physical Data Model: This Data Model describes HOW the system will be implemented using a specific DBMS system. This model is typically created by DBA and developers. The purpose is actual implementation of the database.
		- Relational model
		- ER Model
- Three-schema Architecture

	- Internal level: describes the physical storage structure of the database. The internal schema uses a physical data model and describes the complete details of data storage and access paths for the database.
	- Conceptual level:-describes the structure of the whole database for a community of users. The conceptual schema hides the details of physical storage structures and concentrates on describing entities, data types, relationships, user operations, and constraints
	- External or View level: Each external schema describes the part of the database that a particular user group is interested in and hides the rest of the database from that user group
- Data Independence:- 
	- Logical data independence is the capacity to change the conceptual schema without having to change external schemas or application programs.
	- Physical data independence is the capacity to change the internal schema without having to change the conceptual schema. Hence, the external schemas need not be changed as well. Changes to the internal schema may be needed because some physical files were reorganized—for example, by creating additional
There are several types of data models, each serving a specific purpose in the realm of database design and information systems. Here are some common types of data models:

### 1. **Conceptual Data Model:**
   - **Purpose:** Describes the high-level entities, their relationships, and the business rules governing them.
   - **Focus:** Business concepts and relationships without concern for implementation details.
   - **Example:** Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), UML class diagrams.

### 2. **Logical Data Model:**
   - **Purpose:** Represents the logical structure of the data, including entities, relationships, and attributes.
   - **Focus:** Database-independent representation of data organization and structure.
   - **Example:** Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) with attributes and relationships.

### 3. **Physical Data Model:**
   - **Purpose:** Describes how the data will be stored in a specific database management system (DBMS).
   - **Focus:** Implementation details such as tables, columns, data types, indexes, and constraints.
   - **Example:** Database schema diagrams, SQL scripts defining tables and relationships.

### 4. **Relational Data Model:**
   - **Purpose:** Represents data as tables (relations) with rows and columns.
   - **Focus:** Mathematical and set-based representation of data relationships.
   - **Example:** Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

### 5. **Object-Oriented Data Model:**
   - **Purpose:** Represents data as objects, encapsulating attributes and methods.
   - **Focus:** Modeling real-world entities as objects with properties and behaviors.
   - **Example:** Object-oriented databases, UML object diagrams.

### 6. **Entity-Relationship Model:**
   - **Purpose:** Represents entities, attributes, and relationships between entities.
   - **Focus:** Provides a visual representation of the structure of a database.
   - **Example:** Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD).
