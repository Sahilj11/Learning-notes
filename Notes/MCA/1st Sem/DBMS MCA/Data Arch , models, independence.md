## DATA ARCH
Database architecture focuses on the design, development, implementation and
maintenance of computer programs that store and organize information for businesses,
agencies and institutions.

### Tier of arch
In 1-tier architecture, the DBMS is the only entity where the user directly sits on
the DBMS and uses it. Any changes done here will directly be done on the DBMS itself. It
does not provide handy tools for end-users. Database designers and programmers normally
prefer to use single-tier architecture. 
If the architecture of DBMS is 2-tier, then it must have an application through which the DBMS can be accessed. Programmers use 2-tier architecture where they access the DBMS by means of an application. Here the application
tier is entirely independent of the database in terms of operation, design, and programming.

A 3-tier architecture as shown in figure 4.1 separates its tiers from each other based on
the complexity of the users and how they use the data present in the database. It is the most
widely used architecture to design a DBMS. Multiple-tier database architecture is highly
modifiable, as almost all its components are independent and can be changed
independently.

- Database (Data) Tier −At this tier, the database resides along with its query processing languages. We also have the relations that define the data and their constraints at this level.
- Application (Middle) Tier −At this tier reside the application server and the programs that access the database. For a user, this application tier presents an abstracted view of the database. End-users are unaware of any existence of the database beyond the application. At the other end, the database tier is not aware of any other user beyond the application tier. Hence, the application layer sits in the middle and acts as a mediator between the end-user and the database.
- User (Presentation) Tier − End-users operate on this tier and they know nothing about any existence of the database beyond this layer. At this layer, multiple views of the database can be provided by the application. All views are generated by applications that reside in the application tier

## Data Model
Ensures that all data objects required by the database are accurately represented.
Omission of data will lead to creation of faulty reports and produce incorrect results.

- A data model helps design the database at the conceptual, physical and logical
levels.

- Data Model structure helps to define the relational tables, primary and foreign keys
and stored procedures.

- It provides a clear picture of the base data and can be used by database developers
to create a physical database.
- It is also helpful to identify missing and redundant data.
- Though the initial creation of data model is labor and time consuming, in the long
run, it makes your IT infrastructure upgrade and maintenance cheaper and faster.

1. Conceptual or Object Data Model: This Data Model defines WHAT the system
contains. This model is typically created by Business stakeholders and Data
Architects. The purpose is to organize, scope and define business concepts and
rules.
2. Logical Data Model: Defines HOW the system should be implemented regardless
of the DBMS. This model is typically created by Data Architects and Business
Analysts. The purpose is to developed technical map of rules and data structures.
3. Physical Data Model: This Data Model describes HOW the system will be
implemented using a specific DBMS system. This model is typically created by
DBA and developers. The purpose is actual implementation of the database.
