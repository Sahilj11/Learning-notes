## Intro
The software requirements are description of features and functionalities of the target system. Requirements convey the expectations of users from the software product. The requirements can be obvious or hidden, known or unknown, expected or unexpected from client’s point of view.
### Requirement Engineering
The process to gather the software requirements from client analyze and document them is known as
requirement engineering.
The goal of requirement engineering is to develop and maintain sophisticated and descriptive ‘System Requirements Specification’ document.

#### Process
It is a four step process, which includes –
- Feasibility Study
- Requirement Gathering
- Software Requirement Specification:- SRS is a document created by the system analyst after the requirements are collected from various stakeholders. SRS defines how the intended software will interact with hardware, external interfaces, speed of operation, response time of system, portability of software across various platforms, maintainability, speed of recovery after crashing, Security, Quality, Limitations etc.
	- SRS Should come up with following features
		- User requirements are expressed in natural language.
		- Technical requirements are expressed in structured language, which is used inside the organization.
		- Design description should be written in pseudo code.
		- Format of Forms and GUI screen prints.
		- Conditional and mathematical notations for DFDs etc.
- Software Requirement Validation
##### Feature of good SRS
A complete Software Requirement Specifications must be:
- Clear
- Correct
- Consistent
- Coherent
- Comprehensible
- Modifiable
- Verifiable
- Prioritized
- Unambiguous
- Traceable
- Credible source

### Types of software requirement
Broadly software requirements should be categorized in two categories:
- Functional Requirements: Requirements, which are related to functional aspect of software fall into this category. They define functions and functionality within and from the software system.
	- Search option given to user to search from various invoices.
	- User should be able to mail any report to management.
	- Users can be divided into groups and groups can be given separate rights.
	- Should comply business rules and administrative functions.
- Non functional Requirement:- Requirements, which are not related to functional aspect of software, fall into this category. They are implicit or expected characteristics of software, which users make assumption of
	- Security
	- Logging
	- Storage
	- Configuration
	- Performance
	- Cost

## User Interface req
UI is an important part of any software or hardware or hybrid system. Software is widely accepted if it
is -
- easy to operate
- quick in response
- effectively handling operational errors
- providing simple yet consistent user interface
