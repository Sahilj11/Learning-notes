## Structural analysis 
### What is it 
- top-down approach in which focus is on refining the problem with the help of function performed in the problem domain and data produced by system.
### Principles of SA
- Top-down decomposition approach
- application of divide and conquer principle :- each high level function is independently decomposed into detailed function

### Objective of SA
- To provide graphical representation to develop new software or to enhance the existing software

### Flow Chart vs Structure chart
- flow chart represent the flow of control/logic but it is difficult to identify the different modules of program from its flow . Structure chart identify the different modules of software
- The flow charts do not show the data exchange b/w different module but structure chart represent data exchange b/w modules

## Object oriented methodologies
### What is modeling 
- It is an abstraction of something for the purpose of understanding it before building it 
- Because real system that we want to study are generally very complex . In order to understand the real system , we have to simplify the system
- So a model is an abstraction that hides the non-essential characteristics of a system and highlights those features, wihch are pertinent to understand it 
- Most of modelling techq , for the analysis and design used graphics so the symbols are used acc to certain set of rules of methodology for communicating the complex relationship of information more clearly than the descriptive text
- need
	- To test physical entity before actual building it 
	- To set the basics for communication b/w the client and developer 
	- For finding the different alternatives
	- For reducing the complexity in order to understand the system

## Coding Standards 
### ISO 9126
ISO 9126 is indeed a recognized international standard. ISO/IEC 9126, titled "Software engineering - Product quality," is a standard that defines a framework for the evaluation of software product quality. It provides a set of quality characteristics and sub-characteristics that can be used to assess the quality of software. The standard is often used by software developers, quality assurance professionals, and other stakeholders to evaluate and improve the quality of software products.

1. **Functionality:**
   - **Suitability:** This sub-characteristic assesses the software's capability to meet specific needs and requirements. It considers how well the software satisfies the intended functions and features.
   - **Accuracy:** Accuracy evaluates the precision and correctness of the software's output. It's about ensuring that the software produces accurate results.
   - **Security:** Security measures the software's ability to protect data and functionalities from unauthorized access, ensuring that it is robust against security threats.
   - **Interoperability:** Interoperability checks whether the software can interact and work effectively with other systems, ensuring compatibility and seamless communication.

2. **Reliability:**
   - **Fault Tolerance:** Fault tolerance evaluates the software's ability to continue functioning correctly even in the presence of faults or errors. It measures the system's resilience to failures.
   - **Maturity:** Maturity assesses how well the software has evolved and improved over time. It implies that a mature software is more reliable and stable.
   - **Recoverability:** Recoverability refers to the software's ability to recover from failures or errors, ensuring that it can return to a working state after encountering issues.

3. **Usability:**
   - Usability examines how user-friendly the software is. It focuses on factors like ease of use, intuitiveness, and overall user satisfaction.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - **Time Behavior:** Time behavior assesses how quickly the software performs its tasks, including response times and processing speed.
   - **Resource Behavior:** Resource behavior evaluates how efficiently the software utilizes system resources, such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. Efficient software should use minimal resources.

5. **Maintainability:**
   - **Testability:** Testability measures how easily the software can be tested. It includes aspects like whether it's straightforward to create and run tests to verify its functionality and quality.
   - **Changeability:** Changeability assesses how easily the software can be modified or updated. It includes factors like code maintainability and how well it accommodates changes without introducing new errors.
   - **Analyzability:** Analyzability is about how easy it is to understand and analyze the software's structure and code to identify and diagnose issues.
   - **Stability:** Stability evaluates the software's ability to maintain its quality and performance even after modifications or updates. It should not become less reliable or efficient when changes are made.

6. **Portability:**
   - **Installability:** Installability measures how easily the software can be installed and set up on different platforms and environments.
   - **Adaptability:** Adaptability assesses how well the software can adapt to different operating environments and configurations.
   - **Replaceability:** Replaceability evaluates how easily the software can be replaced by another system or component without causing disruption to the overall system.

These quality characteristics and sub-characteristics provide a structured way to assess and evaluate software quality, ensuring that software meets user expectations, performs reliably, and can be maintained and adapted effectively.
ISO/IEC 9126 helps organizations and software developers to set quality objectives, make informed decisions about software development and maintenance, and communicate quality requirements to all stakeholders.
### Software vs Hardware relability 
![](../../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020231021112959.png)

**Software Reliability:**

Software reliability refers to the probability that a software system will perform its intended functions without failures over a specified period of time and under certain conditions. It is a measure of the software's ability to operate correctly and consistently. Software reliability is related to how well the software behaves under various circumstances, and it involves factors like error rates, availability, and mean time between failures (MTBF).

**Hardware Reliability:**

Hardware reliability, on the other hand, focuses on the reliability of physical components and devices within a computer system. It assesses the probability that hardware components (e.g., processors, memory, storage devices) will operate without failures over a specific duration and under specific environmental conditions. Hardware reliability often involves metrics like mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to repair (MTTR), and failure rates.

**Hardware Reliability Curve:**

### McCall Quality Model
The McCall Quality Model is a well-known framework for understanding and assessing software quality. It was developed by John McCall and his colleagues in the 1970s and is based on the idea that software quality can be broken down into multiple, interrelated factors. These factors are organized into three categories: product revision, product transition, and product operation.

- **Product operation factors** − Correctness, Reliability, Efficiency, Integrity, Usability.
- **Product revision factors** − Maintainability, Flexibility, Testability.
- **Product transition factors** − Portability, Reusability, Interoperability.

Here are some key notes about the McCall Quality Model:

### CMM
CMM in software engineering stands for "Capability Maturity Model." The Capability Maturity Model is a framework used to assess and improve an organization's software development and management processes. The primary goal of the CMM is to help organizations enhance their software development and maintenance processes, resulting in higher-quality software products.

The CMM for Software consists of five maturity levels, which represent increasing levels of process maturity and capability:
1. **Initial (Level 1):** At this level, processes are often ad hoc, chaotic, and unpredictable. There is a lack of control and documentation of software development processes.
2. **Repeatable (Level 2):** Organizations at this level have established basic project management and process controls, which enable them to repeat successful practices. Key processes are documented and followed. 
   - Project planning
   - Software project tracking and oversight
   - Software quality assurance
3. **Defined (Level 3):** At this level, organizations have well-defined and standardized software development processes. There is a focus on process improvement, and organizations collect data to analyze and improve processes continuously.
- Traning programme
- Integrated software management 
- Software product engineering
4. **Managed (Level 4):** Organizations at this level use quantitative data to manage and control processes. The focus is on optimizing processes and achieving higher efficiency and quality.
5. **Optimizing (Level 5):** At the highest level, organizations continuously improve their processes to achieve excellence. They use innovative and advanced techniques to further enhance their processes.
- Defect prevention 
- Technology change management 
- Process change management
## Reliability metric of software products 
Reliability is a crucial quality attribute for software products, as it measures the software's ability to perform its functions consistently and correctly over time. There are several metrics and methods to assess the reliability of software products:

1. **Failure Rate:** This metric measures the frequency of software failures over a specific period. It's often expressed as the number of failures per unit of time.

2. **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):** MTBF is the average time between two consecutive failures. It provides an estimate of how long the software can run without experiencing a failure. A higher MTBF indicates better reliability.

3. **Mean Time to Failure (MTTF):** MTTF represents the average time it takes for a software component to fail. Like MTBF, a higher MTTF indicates better reliability.

4. **Availability:** Availability measures the percentage of time that the software is operational and available for use. It's the complement of downtime, and higher availability is associated with higher reliability.

5. **Fault Density:** This metric quantifies the number of defects or faults in a software product relative to its size (e.g., lines of code or function points). Lower fault density is typically indicative of better reliability.

### Approach to improve software reliability
Here's an explanation of each point in the approach to improve software reliability:

1. **Fault Avoidance:**
   - Fault avoidance involves taking preventive measures during the software development process to minimize the introduction of defects or faults. This can be achieved through proper coding practices, adherence to coding standards, and the use of design patterns that are known to reduce common software issues.

2. **Fault Detection and Removal:**
   - This step focuses on identifying and eliminating defects within the software. It involves techniques like code reviews, testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing), and using debugging tools to find and rectify errors in the code.

3. **Fault Tolerance:**
   - Fault tolerance is the capability of a system to continue functioning in the presence of faults or errors. It involves designing the software in a way that it can handle unexpected failures gracefully, such as using redundancy, error-checking, and error recovery mechanisms.

4. **Damage Assessment:**
   - Damage assessment is the process of evaluating the impact of a fault or failure on the software and the system as a whole. It helps in understanding the extent of the damage caused by a fault, which can be crucial in deciding how to proceed with fault recovery and repair.

5. **Fault Recovery:**
   - Fault recovery involves actions taken to restore the software to a functional state after a fault has been detected. This may include rolling back to a previous state, restarting a failed component, or implementing strategies to mitigate the impact of the fault.

6. **Fault Repair:**
   - Fault repair is the process of fixing the root cause of the fault and ensuring that it doesn't occur again. This often requires code changes and may involve patching, updating, or redesigning parts of the software to eliminate the defect.

By following these steps in a systematic manner, software developers and engineers can significantly enhance the reliability of a software system and reduce the likelihood of failures and faults that could lead to disruptions or errors in the application.

## Software Quality Management System
### Intro 
A quality management system (often referred to as quality system) is the principal methodology used by organisations to ensure that the
products they develop have the desired quality.

### Quality system activity
The quality system activities encompass the following:
- Auditing of projects to check if the processes are being followed.
- Collect process and product metrics and analyse them to check if
quality goals are being met.
- Review of the quality system to make it more effective.
- Development of standards, procedures, and guidelines.
- Produce reports for the top management summarising the
effectiveness of the quality system in the organisation.
### Evolution of Quality systems
Quality systems have rapidly evolved over the last six decades. Prior to World
War II, the usual method to produce quality products was to inspect the
finished products to eliminate defective products.
![](../../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020231021113950.png)

Quality Control (QC), Quality Assurance (QA), and Total Quality Management (TQM) are three related concepts in the field of quality management. They are often used in a progression to ensure product or service quality, and their evolution reflects an increasing emphasis on continuous improvement and customer satisfaction.

1. **Quality Control (QC):**
   Quality Control is a process-oriented approach focused on identifying and correcting defects in the final product or service. It involves inspecting and testing a representative sample of the output to ensure it meets predefined quality standards. If defects are found, corrective actions are taken. QC is a reactive approach, primarily concerned with maintaining consistency in the final product.

2. **Quality Assurance (QA):**
   Quality Assurance is a more proactive and comprehensive approach to quality management. QA encompasses the processes and systems used to create a product or service and ensures that they are designed, implemented, and maintained in a way that meets established quality standards. It involves preventing defects rather than just detecting and correcting them. QA aims to ensure that the entire process is capable of delivering a quality product consistently.

3. **Total Quality Management (TQM):**
   Total Quality Management is a holistic and organization-wide approach to quality. It involves a cultural shift in which every employee is responsible for maintaining and improving quality at all levels of the organization. TQM emphasizes customer satisfaction, continuous improvement, and the involvement of all employees in quality-related decisions and actions. TQM principles include customer focus, leadership, employee involvement, process improvement, and fact-based decision making.

**Evolution of Quality Systems:**
- **Inspection and QC (Historical Approach):** In the past, quality control was primarily based on the inspection of final products. This approach was reactive and focused on identifying defects after they occurred.

- **Introduction of QA (Mid-20th Century):** As industries expanded and products became more complex, a need arose for a more systematic approach to quality. This led to the development of Quality Assurance, which emphasized the importance of well-defined processes and procedures to ensure product quality.

- **TQM and Continuous Improvement (Late 20th Century):** TQM gained prominence in the late 20th century, driven by the works of quality gurus like Deming and Juran. TQM emphasized the involvement of all employees in quality improvement, customer focus, and a shift from mere compliance to continuous improvement. It represented a broader and more strategic perspective on quality.

- **Integration of Quality Approaches (Contemporary):** Modern quality management systems often integrate elements of QC, QA, and TQM. They recognize that all three approaches have their place in maintaining and improving quality. Companies implement robust QA systems and incorporate TQM principles to ensure ongoing quality while also using QC techniques when necessary to verify product quality.

In summary, the evolution of quality systems has moved from a reactive QC approach to a proactive QA approach, ultimately culminating in TQM, which focuses on continuous improvement and a culture of quality throughout an organization. In practice, a well-rounded quality management system may incorporate elements of all three approaches to achieve the best results and meet customer expectations.

## Software quality attribute
### What are these attribute
- Mention all ISO 9000 

## Reviews
software reviews are systematic evaluation of software in order to remove error . these reviews are conducted in various phases of software developement process such as analysis , design and coding 
Obj of soft review is to ensure that quality of software is maintained in each phase of software development 
### Software review team 
- Author or producer:- responsible for making correction in product when review is over
- Moderator or review leader:- Ensures that review procedures are performed throughout the reivew meeting . Assembles team and keeps review meeting on schedule . Organise schedule of product to be reviewed
- Recorder:- recorde important issue of product , which arise during a review meeting . A document is prepared containing the result of review meeting
- Reviewer:- Analyzes the product and prepares notes before the review meeting begins . there can be more than one reviewer in team depending on the size of product 

### Type of software review
#### Walkthrough
- Review is an informal one , which is used to evaluate the product . No preparation is made in advance and due to this the walkthrough are termed as unplanned activity
#### FTR
- Formal review performed by review team . It is performed in any phase of software developemnt 
- Each FTR is conducted as meeting and is considered successful only if it is properly planned , conducted and attended 
- obj
	- To detect error in functioning of software and error occuring due to incorrect logic 
	- To check that whether product being reviewd accomplishes the requirement or not
	- To ensure that product is developed using established standards
### Stages of review meeting
- 
### Three ways to do it 
#### Informal meeting 
#### Formal presentation
#### Formal technical review 
- It is software quality assurance performed by software engineers 
- Identify error in logic , functionality and implementation
- Check if all the req are implemented / not
- also check if software is according to the standards
- It is 4 step process
Formal Technical Reviews (FTRs) are a structured approach to evaluating software artifacts in software development. The following are explanations of the four steps involved in FTR, which include review meetings, review reporting and record-keeping, review guidelines, and sample-driven reviews:

1. **Review Meeting**:

   - **Explanation**: The review meeting is a formal, structured discussion where a group of participants, including developers, testers, subject matter experts, and other stakeholders, come together to evaluate a specific software artifact. This step is central to the FTR process.

   - **Purpose**: The primary goal of the review meeting is to collaboratively assess the software artifact, identify defects, discrepancies, and potential improvements, and decide on actions to address the identified issues.

   - **Key Elements**:
     - **Opening**: The meeting begins with an introduction, led by a moderator or facilitator, where the purpose and agenda of the review are explained.
     - **Presentation (Optional)**: The author of the artifact may provide context or clarifications through a brief presentation.
     - **Discussion**: Reviewers discuss their findings, focusing on objective evaluation and constructive feedback.
     - **Issue Resolution**: Identified issues and defects are discussed, and resolutions are proposed.
     - **Documentation**: Meeting notes are taken, capturing discussions, issues, and resolutions.
     - **Closing**: The meeting concludes with a summary of discussions and agreed-upon actions, including a plan for follow-up activities, such as re-reviews.

2. **Review Reporting and Record Keeping**:

   - **Explanation**: After the review meeting, the findings, issues, and resolutions from the meeting are documented in a formal review report. This report serves as a record of the review process and its outcomes.

   - **Purpose**: The review report provides a structured and comprehensive summary of the review activities, findings, and decisions, and it serves as a reference for further actions and process improvement.

   - **Key Components**:
     - **Documenting Findings**: Findings from the meeting notes are documented, often categorized by severity or priority.
     - **Formalizing the Report**: The meeting notes are transformed into a formal review report, presenting the findings in a structured manner.
     - **Distribution**: The review report is distributed to relevant stakeholders, including the author, reviewers, and management.
     - **Reference and Follow-Up**: The report is used as a reference for future actions and to track progress on issue resolutions.
     - **Archiving**: The review report and associated documentation are archived for historical and audit purposes.

3. **Review Guidelines**:

   - **Explanation**: Review guidelines are established rules and principles that guide the FTR process. They define the expectations, responsibilities, and procedures for conducting a review.

   - **Purpose**: Review guidelines help ensure consistency and quality in the review process, providing a common framework for all participants to follow.

   - **Key Elements**:
     - **Roles and Responsibilities**: Guidelines define the roles of the participants, including the moderator, author, and reviewers.
     - **Review Criteria**: They specify the criteria that the reviewers should consider when evaluating the artifact.
     - **Meeting Structure**: Guidelines outline the structure of the review meeting, including the agenda and the order of activities.
     - **Documentation Standards**: Guidelines may specify how findings should be documented and reported.
     - **Tailoring**: Guidelines can be tailored to the specific needs and context of the project or organization.

4. **Sample-Driven Review**:

   - **Explanation**: Sample-driven reviews involve reviewing specific, representative sections or samples of a larger software artifact, such as source code or documentation, rather than examining the entire artifact.

   - **Purpose**: This approach is used to streamline the review process, especially when the full review of a large artifact is impractical or time-consuming. Sample-driven reviews aim to identify common issues and trends based on the selected samples.

   - **Key Elements**:
     - **Sample Selection**: Specific sections or samples are chosen for review. These samples should be representative of the overall artifact.
     - **Focused Evaluation**: Reviewers concentrate their efforts on analyzing the selected samples, looking for patterns and issues that may apply more broadly.
     - **Efficiency**: Sample-driven reviews save time and resources compared to reviewing the entire artifact while still providing valuable feedback.
## Improving reliability 
Certainly, here are six key approaches to improve the reliability of software:

1. **Thorough Testing**: Conduct comprehensive functional, non-functional, and regression testing to identify and address issues and ensure the software meets its requirements.

2. **Code Reviews**: Regularly perform peer code reviews to identify coding errors, potential defects, and maintain coding standards.

3. **Static Analysis Tools**: Use automated static analysis tools to scan source code for vulnerabilities and coding errors.

4. **Robust Error Handling**: Implement robust error and exception handling to prevent crashes and gracefully recover from errors.

5. **Configuration Management**: Use configuration management practices to control and track changes, ensuring consistency.

6. **Continuous Improvement**: Implement quality assurance processes and continuously improve development processes to prevent defects and enhance reliability.

### Software quality assurance activities
To ensure that software developement is in accordance with established standards, SQA activities are followed
It is classified into process quality assurance and product quality assurance activity
Software Quality Assurance (SQA) activities are integral to ensuring that software products meet predefined quality standards and are delivered to customers with the highest level of reliability and performance. SQA activities can be broadly categorized into two main types: Process Quality Assurance and Product Quality Assurance.

1. **Process Quality Assurance Activities:**

   Process Quality Assurance focuses on evaluating and improving the processes used to develop, test, and maintain software. This helps in ensuring that the software development lifecycle follows best practices and standards. Key activities in Process Quality Assurance include:

   a. **Process Definition and Improvement:** Define and refine software development processes, incorporating industry best practices such as Agile, Scrum, or DevOps. Continuously assess and improve these processes for efficiency and effectiveness.

   b. **Standards and Guidelines:** Establish and enforce coding standards, design guidelines, and documentation requirements. This ensures consistency and quality in the software development process.

   c. **Training and Skill Development:** Provide training and skill development programs for team members to ensure that they are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to follow the established processes.

   d. **Quality Audits and Reviews:** Conduct regular audits and reviews of development activities to identify and rectify process deviations, non-compliance, and areas for improvement.

   e. **Metrics and Measurements:** Define and track key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the development process. Metrics can include defect density, code coverage, and project progress.

   f. **Process Documentation:** Document all processes, procedures, and guidelines so that team members have a reference and can follow them consistently.

2. **Product Quality Assurance Activities:**

   Product Quality Assurance focuses on ensuring that the software product itself meets the required quality standards. It involves activities that directly impact the software product's quality and reliability. Key activities in Product Quality Assurance include:

   a. **Requirements Verification:** Validate that the software requirements are complete, clear, and feasible. Ensure that the product under development aligns with the customer's needs and expectations.

   b. **Design and Code Reviews:** Conduct design and code reviews to identify issues, such as coding errors, design flaws, or security vulnerabilities, and ensure adherence to established coding standards.

   c. **Testing and Test Automation:** Plan and execute testing activities, including functional, integration, performance, and security testing. Implement test automation to increase test coverage and efficiency.

   d. **Defect Tracking and Management:** Monitor and manage defects identified during testing and development to ensure they are properly documented, prioritized, and addressed.

   e. **Configuration Management:** Manage the software configuration, including version control and change management, to ensure that the product is stable and that changes are tracked and controlled.

   f. **Release Management:** Coordinate and manage the release of software products to ensure that they are stable, well-documented, and meet customer expectations.

   g. **Customer Feedback and Satisfaction:** Gather and analyze feedback from customers and end-users to improve the product's quality and meet their evolving needs.

Both Process and Product Quality Assurance activities are crucial for delivering high-quality software. Process Quality Assurance helps in establishing a strong foundation for development, while Product Quality Assurance ensures that the end product meets the specified quality criteria. These activities should be integrated into the software development lifecycle to minimize risks, enhance productivity, and improve the overall quality of the software being developed.

## SRS
### Intro
- Output of req phase of software developement process is SRS
- All other activities of software engineering are dependent on SRS
- Need
	- Purpose of SRS is to minimise the communication gap b/w two parties through the interactions or meeting 
	- The process of development of SRS helps the clients to think , visualise and interacpt with analyst about requirement
	- SRS establish basis of agreement b/w two parties of software developement 
	- SRS provides reference for final Product 
- Feature of SRS
	- Completeness:- SRS is said to be complete if everything the software is supposed to do is described
	- Correctness:- means that what is specified is done correctly 
	- Verifiable:- if every stated requirement is verifiable
	- Consistent:- if there is no requirement that conflict with other
	- Prioritization:- some requirement are core requirement that do not changes but there are some requirement that changes with time
	- Modifiable:- if structure of SRS is such that any necessary changes can be incorporated
- Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) typically comprise various components that provide a detailed description of what a software system is expected to do and how it should perform. The components often include:

1. **Functional Requirements:**
   - Functional requirements describe the specific functions or features that the software must perform. These requirements outline the behavior of the system, including inputs, processes, and outputs. They provide a detailed view of the software's capabilities and functionalities, often in the form of use cases, user stories, or functional specifications.

2. **Performance Requirements:**
   - Performance requirements specify the system's performance criteria, such as response times, throughput, scalability, and reliability. These requirements ensure that the software meets certain performance standards and can handle expected workloads efficiently.

3. **Design Constraints:**
   - Design constraints outline limitations or restrictions on the design and development of the software. These constraints can be related to technology choices, budget constraints, compliance with industry standards, or other factors that may affect the design and implementation of the software.

4. **External Interface Requirements:**
   - External interface requirements define how the software will interact with external systems, including other software applications, hardware devices, and users. They specify communication protocols, data formats, and interactions between the software and external entities. This includes APIs, user interfaces, and data exchange requirements.

These components collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of what the software needs to accomplish and how it should perform in various contexts. SRS documents serve as a critical foundation for software development, helping stakeholders, including developers, testers, and clients, to have a common understanding of the project's objectives and constraints.

### Guidelines of SRS
- Functionality should be separate from implementation 
- Analysis model should be developed as per desired behavior of system
- The cognitive model should be developed 
- The content and strucutre of specification should be flexible
