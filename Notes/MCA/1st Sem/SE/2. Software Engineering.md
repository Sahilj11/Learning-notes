## Data modeling 
Data modeling is the process of creating a conceptual representation of data and its relationships in order to understand and manage data effectively. It is a crucial step in database design and information system development. Data modeling helps in organizing and structuring data so that it can be stored, accessed, and analyzed efficiently

if application is data intensive then ER model can be used to produce conceptual data model of system

ER diagram servers as a documentation tool
### Obj of data modelling 
- to identify the data items in application and relationship b/w those identified data items 
- to create conceptual schema for the data.

#### ER Model
- IEEE defines "diagram that depicts the set of real world entities and logical relationship among them"
- Basic units 
	- Entities
	- type of entities
	- relationship 
	- Attributes
**Already covered in DBMS**

## Structural analysis 
### What is it 
- top-down approach in which focus is on refining the problem with the help of function performed in the problem domain and data produced by system.
### Principles of SA
- Top-down decomposition approach
- application of divide and conquer principle :- each high level function is independently decomposed into detailed function

### Objective of SA
- To provide graphical representation to develop new software or to enhance the existing software

### Tools for structural analysis
#### Data flow diagram
##### Intro
- diagram that depicts data sources , data sinks , data storage , processes performed on data as nodes and logical flow of data as the links b/w the nodes
- it is also called Data flow graph / Bubble Chart/ Bubble Graph
##### DFD vs Flow Chart 
- DFD should not be confused with flow chart . DFD represent the flow of data whereas flow chart represent flow of control/logic 

##### Obj of DFD
- Represent the system data in hierarchical order with req lvl of details
- Depicts the processes according to the defined user req and scope of software 
- To provide the overview of transformation that occur in the input data within the system to produce the output
- DFD depicts the flow of data within the system and considers a system that transform the input into req outputs 
- WHen the system is complex then data needs to be transformed by various steps to produce the output . These steps are required to refine the requirement 
##### +ve of DFD
- Provides the functional decomposition of proposed system
- provides the details of data flow in proposed system
- communicates the existing system knowledge to stakeholder
##### Units of DFD
- DFD shows the flow of data through a system . it views the system as function that transforms the input into desired outputs . any complex system does not perform the transformation in the single step but undergoes into number of transformation before it becomes the output
- Process:- 
	- The agent that performs the transformation from one state to another is called a process or bubble . Process is represented by named/ labeled circle.
- Data flow:-
	- Data flow is represented by named / labeled arrow
- Data store:- 
	- Data store is represented by open rectangle . Open rectangle should be named or labeled 
- Source or sink / External entity:- Source (originator of data) and sink(consumer of data) is represented by labeled rectangle 
- ![[Pasted image 20231008151125.png]]

##### Guidelines for creating DFD
- Meaninful names to be given to DFD notation . eg . in general the verbs should be used for naming a process where nouns should be used for the external entity , data flow and data store
- DFD should be created in organised order so that it can be easily understood
- Each process should be numbered uniquely 
- All the symbols used in DFD should be labeled

##### Synchronous and Asynchronous Operations of DFD
- ![[Pasted image 20231008151757.png]]

##### Developing DFD model of system
- DFD shows the flow of data through system . it views the system as function that transforms input into desired outputs
**LEVELED DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS**
- Any complex system does not perform the transformation in single step but undergoes into the number of transformation before it becomes the output
- Context diagram :- context diagram is most abstract data flow 
	- it is the most abstract data flow representation of system. it represent the entire system as a single bubble . In fig the banking system is represented as single process . Process banking system is represented by circle . User is the source and user is sink . Source and sink are represented by rectangle . Data flow represented by arrow
	- To develop the context diagram of system is to be analysed to identify the different type users who would be using system and the kinds of data they would be inputting to the system and the kinds of data they would be receiving from the system . Context lvl DFD is called as 0-lvl DFD
	- ![[Pasted image 20231008152638.png]]
	- 
- LVL 1- DFD :- Context lvl DFD is decomposed into LVL1 - DFD
	- User entity (source) is related to several processes in the bank which includes register. User support and provide cash . The transaction can be performed if the user is already registered in the bank
	- once user is registered . he can perform the transaction by the processes namely Deposit cheque , deposit cash and withdraw cash
	- The line in the process symbol indicates the level of process and contains a unique identifier in the form of number 
	- The user info such as name , address and account number is stored in data store User_detail
	- It is not necessary that the user is registered in the bank to have the demand draft then the details of the cash and date are stored in the data store , DD_detail
	- Once the demand draft is prepared then its receipt is provided to the user (sink)
	- ![[Pasted image 20231008153505.png]]
- LVL2 - DFD :- Processes of LVL 1 is decomposed into LVL 2
	- ![[Pasted image 20231008153536.png]]
	- 
- LVL 3 - DFD :- Processs of LVL 2 is decomposed into LVL 3
	- ![[Pasted image 20231008153607.png]]
- this process of decomposition is up to N level and it depends upon the details required in DFD

##### Informal verfication of DFD and data dictionary 
- After construction of DFD , an analyst can perform the walkthrough and look for error 
	- Unlabelled data flows 
	- Missing data flow 
	- Missing processes 
	- Consistency not maintained during the refinement
### Steps of SA
- study the physical environment of system
	- During this step DFD of current non automated system is drawn which shows the input and output data flows 
	- How the data flows through the system ?
	- what are the different processs operating on data 
	- While drawing the DFD for physical env the analyst have to interact with the users to determine the overall process from the point of view of data 
	- In this step context diagram is created in which the entire system is treated as a single process . in the context diagram all the inputs to the process , outputs from process , sources and sinks are identified and drawn
- Decomposition of process
	- Based on top down refiendment the context lvl process is decomposed into diff levels
- Draw logical equivalents of DFD for physical system
	- During this step the DFD physical env is taken and all the specific data flows are represented by their logical equivalents . the physical bubbles may be replaced by the logical processes . bubbles that do not transforms data in any form may be deleted from DFD
- Modeling the current system:- During the first two steps the current system is modeled and the next step is to model the new system after the changes have been incorporated . what are data flows and what are the major processes in this new system must be determined by analyst based upon his experience and vision
- Establishing the man machine boundary:- The next step is to establish the man machine boundary by specifying that what needs to automated and what will remain manual in new system.

## Data dictionary 
### Intro
- When system analysis is performed then it is essential for the system analyst to decide the necessary data for designing the application 
- DFD gives the info about the data flows and data stores of system so the individual data item of data flows and data stores can be catalogued . The catalogue can bring out that if any data is missing or duplicated . Such a catalogue is called data dictionary or data repository
- DD is essential tool in SDP to describe the DD sufficient info should be collected about the data items
- DD is a data repository which stores the info about system data at one place
- The DD is a reference work of data about data (metadata)
### Format of DD
![[Pasted image 20231008160749.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231008160848.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231008160906.png]]
### Others 
- DD should contains info about the following 
	- Data flows
		- ![[Pasted image 20231008161205.png]]
		- 
		- Is described by means of DFD . these are path along which data travels and data stores and places where data is stored. it can be said that data flow are data structure in motion and data stores are data structure in rest
	- Data stores
		- ![[Pasted image 20231008161225.png]]
	- Processes
		- ![[Pasted image 20231008161249.png]]
	- External Entities
		- ![[Pasted image 20231008161306.png]]
### Data Dictionary classes
- Data element :- it is the smallest unit of data and is also called as data item. each data element should be properly documented in data dictionary
- Data structure:- Once data items are defined then DS req by particular system under consideration can be identified . Data elements are combined to form DS
- ![[Pasted image 20231008161524.png]]
### use of DD
- important documentation which would be useful to maintain the system
- purpose of DD is to provide a source of reference for analyst , user and designer
- Analyst use the DD for collecting , documenting and for organising the specific facts about system
- It eliminates the redundancy 
- helps in validation of DFD
- becomes the starting point for developing the screen reports and forms

## Structure chart 
### What is it 
- Graphic depiction of decomposition of problem . Structure chart illustrate the partitioning of modules into sub modules . SC are used to show the communication b/w modules
- show the control and dataflow b/w modules
- SC represent the hierarchical structure of modul
- helps the programmer to divide the problems into smaller parts so that problem can be easily understood 
- it is used as tool to help in software design
- in design stage the structure chart is drawn and is used by clients and by designer to communicate b.w them
### Components of SC
- Modules 
- Connection b/w modules
- Communication b/w modules
### Basic building block of SC
![[Pasted image 20231008162330.png]]
### Modules
- ![[Pasted image 20231008162541.png]]
- types
	- Control module: Module at top in figure is called as root module also called control module
	- Subordinate module:- Modules can be subordinate module . In fig module i.e m1 , m2 are subordinate modules and these are also represented by rectangles
	- Library modules:- usually represented by rectangle with double edge . comprises the frequently called modules. when the module is invoked by many other module then it is made into library module 
	- ![[Pasted image 20231008162815.png]]
### Arrow 
![[Pasted image 20231008162912.png]]
### Data couple
![[Pasted image 20231008162946.png]]

### Control couple
![[Pasted image 20231008163022.png]]

### Diamond box
- it is used for indicating decision and depending upon decision one of the sub modules can be invoked
- In figure it is shown that module Print valid customer No . takes the decision based on the flag (control couple) valid customer no . whether to print a customer no. or to print an error message . Based on the decision the relevant module can be invoked ie. if customer no is valid then the print customer no . module is invoked otherwise module print error message is invoked
- ![[Pasted image 20231014153943.png]]

### Arc with arrow head 
- represent iteration
- a loop around control flow arrows denotes that the respective modules are invoked repeatedly 
- The number of modules that come within the loop is shown by number of arrows invoking modules
- In fig it is shown that three sub modules . Get customer no, validate customer no and print customer no are invoked repeatedly by the print valid customer no.
- ![[Pasted image 20231014154157.png]]

### Layered approach
- In any structure chart there should be one and only one module at the top called root
- There should be at most one control relationship b/w any two modules in the structure chart i.e if a module A is invokes module B then module B cannot invoke module A
- The layered design and poorly layered design is shown in fig
- ![[Pasted image 20231014154407.png]]

### Flow Chart vs Structure chart
- flow chart represent the flow of control/logic but it is difficult to identify the different modules of program from its flow . Structure chart identify the different modules of software
- The flow charts do not show the data exchange b/w different module but structure chart represent data exchange b/w modules
### Steps to create structure chart
1. First depict relation of modules from top to bottom
2. Conceptualise the main sub tasks that must be performed by program to solve the problem
3. Focus is given on each subtask and conceptualised that how each sub task can be broken into smaller tasks
4. Once the Strucutred chart is designed then the bottom up implementation of each module

## Object oriented methodologies
### What is modeling 
- It is an abstraction of something for the purpose of understanding it before building it 
- Because real system that we want to study are generally very complex . In order to understand the real system , we have to simplify the system
- So a model is an abstraction that hides the non-essential characteristics of a system and highlights those features, wihch are pertinent to understand it 
- Most of modelling techq , for the analysis and design used graphics so the symbols are used acc to certain set of rules of methodology for communicating the complex relationship of information more clearly than the descriptive text
- need
	- To test physical entity before actual building it 
	- To set the basics for communication b/w the client and developer 
	- For finding the different alternatives
	- For reducing the complexity in order to understand the system
