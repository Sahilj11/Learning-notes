## Package

**java package** is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.

#### Creating package

The **package keyword** is used to create a package in java.

```java
- //save as Simple.java  
- package mypack;  
- public class Simple{  
-  public static void main(String args[]){  
-     System.out.println("Welcome to package");  
-    }  
- }
```

#### Compile package

```java
javac -d directory javafilename
javac -d . Simple.java
```

The -d switch specifies the destination where to put the generated class file. You can use any directory name like /home (in case of Linux), d:/abc (in case of windows) etc. If you want to keep the package within the same directory, you can use . (dot).

You need to use fully qualified name e.g. mypack.Simple etc to run the class.
**To Compile:** javac -d . Simple.java
**To Run:** java mypack.Simple

#### How to access package from another package?

There are three ways to access the package from outside the package.

1. import package.`*`;
   ![](../../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020231023084442.png)
2. import package.classname;
   ![](../../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020231023084520.png)

3. fully qualified name.
   ![](../../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020231023084537.png)

#### Subpackage

Package inside the package is called the **subpackage**. It should be created **to categorize the package further**.

Package in java can be categorized in two form, built-in package and user-defined package.
In Java, a package is a mechanism for organizing related classes and interfaces into a single, coherent namespace. Packages provide a way to structure your code, avoid naming conflicts, and make your code more maintainable and modular. They are essential for organizing and managing larger Java applications. Here's a detailed explanation of packages in Java:

1. **What is a Package?**  
   A package is a directory that contains a group of related Java classes and interfaces. It provides a hierarchical way to organize your Java code. Packages are used to avoid naming conflicts and to create a modular, well-organized codebase.

2. **Why Use Packages?**

   - **Organization:** Packages help you organize your classes logically. You can group related classes and interfaces together within a package.
   - **Access Control:** Packages can control the access to classes and their members (fields and methods). You can specify the access level using the `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default (no modifier) access modifiers.
   - **Naming Conflicts:** Packages help avoid naming conflicts. If two classes with the same name exist in different packages, there won't be a conflict as long as you use the fully qualified name (package name + class name) to refer to them.

3. **Package Naming Convention:**

   - Package names are typically written in lowercase letters to distinguish them from class names, which usually start with an uppercase letter.
   - Package names usually follow the reverse domain name convention to ensure uniqueness. For example, if your domain is `example.com`, you might create a package named `com.example.myapp`.

4. **Creating Packages:**  
   To create a package, you need to do the following:

   - Include a `package` declaration at the top of your Java source file. For example:
     ```java
     package com.example.myapp;
     ```
   - Save the Java source file in a directory structure that matches the package name. For the example above, you'd save the file in a directory like `com/example/myapp`.

5. **Accessing Classes in Packages:**  
   To access a class or interface from a package, you can use the `import` statement in your Java source code. For example:

   ```java
   import com.example.myapp.MyClass;
   ```

   You can then use `MyClass` in your code without specifying the full package name each time.

6. **Classpath:**  
   When compiling or running Java code, the Java classpath needs to include the root directory where your package directory structure resides. This enables the Java compiler and runtime to find your classes. You can set the classpath using the `-cp` or `-classpath` option.

7. **Standard Java Packages:**  
   Java provides a set of standard packages, such as `java.util`, `java.io`, and `java.lang`, which contain classes and interfaces that are fundamental to the Java language.

8. **Nested Packages:**  
   You can also create nested packages within packages. For example, if you have a package `com.example.myapp`, you can create a subpackage `com.example.myapp.util` to further organize your code.

9. **Package Visibility:**

   - Classes with default (package-private) access can be accessed only within the same package.
   - Classes with `public` access can be accessed from anywhere.

10. **Jar Files:**  
    You can package classes from multiple packages into a JAR (Java Archive) file. This makes it easy to distribute and share libraries or applications.

In summary, packages in Java provide a way to structure, organize, and manage your code, prevent naming conflicts, and control access to classes and their members. They are an essential part of writing modular and maintainable Java applications.

### Creating package and accessing it

Creating a package and accessing it in Java involves a series of steps. I'll explain the process in detail:

**Creating a Package:**

1. **Package Structure:** To create a package, you need to decide on a package name and organize your source code accordingly. The package name should follow the naming conventions, typically in reverse domain name style, such as `com.example.myapp`.

2. **Directory Structure:** The directory structure should match the package name. For example, if your package is named `com.example.myapp`, you would create a directory structure like this:

   ```
   project_root
   └── com
       └── example
           └── myapp
   ```

   Inside the `myapp` directory, you'll place your Java source files.

3. **Package Declaration:** In your Java source files, you need to include a `package` declaration at the top of each file. The `package` declaration specifies the package name for the classes in that file. For example:

   ```java
   package com.example.myapp;
   ```

   Place this declaration at the very top of each `.java` file.

4. **Compile Source Files:** Compile your Java source files using the `javac` command. Make sure that your class files are generated in the correct directory structure, matching the package name. For example:

   ```
   javac -d project_root src/com/example/myapp/MyClass.java
   ```

   This will compile `MyClass.java` and place the resulting `.class` file in the appropriate directory structure.

**Accessing a Package:**

Once you have created a package, you can access it in other classes or packages using the `import` statement. Here's how you can access classes and interfaces from a package:

1. **Import Statement:** To access a class or interface from a package, you can use the `import` statement. This statement informs the Java compiler that you want to use a class from a specific package. You can place `import` statements at the top of your Java source file, below the package declaration (if there is one) and above the class declaration.

   ```java
   import com.example.myapp.MyClass;
   ```

   In this example, we're importing the `MyClass` class from the `com.example.myapp` package.

2. **Using Classes:** After importing the class, you can use it in your code without specifying the full package name each time. For example, you can create an instance of `MyClass`:

   ```java
   MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
   ```

   Since you've imported `MyClass`, you don't need to use the full package name when creating objects or invoking methods on this class.

3. **Accessing Nested Packages:** If you have nested packages within your package, you can import classes from these nested packages in a similar way. For instance, if you have a nested package `com.example.myapp.util`, you can import a class from this nested package as follows:

   ```java
   import com.example.myapp.util.UtilityClass;
   ```

   Then you can use `UtilityClass` in your code as needed.

4. **Access Modifier:** The access modifier of a class (e.g., `public`, `private`, `protected`, default) in a package affects how it can be accessed from other classes and packages. For example, if a class is declared as `public`, it can be accessed from any package. If it has default (package-private) access, it can only be accessed within the same package.

In summary, creating and accessing packages in Java involves organizing your source code in a directory structure that matches the package name, including a `package` declaration in your source files, and using `import` statements to access classes from other packages. This helps you structure your code, avoid naming conflicts, and make your Java application more modular and organized.

### Advantage of Java Package

1. Java package is used to categorize the classes and interfaces so that they can be easily maintained.

2. Java package provides access protection.

3. Java package removes naming collision.

### Stream

In Java, a stream is a sequence of elements that you can process sequentially. Streams are a powerful and flexible feature introduced in Java 8 as a part of the Java Stream API, which is part of the `java.util.stream` package. Streams provide a way to work with collections of data in a more functional and declarative style. They offer a set of high-level operations that can be applied to collections, making it easier to perform various data manipulation tasks.

Here are some key characteristics and concepts related to streams in Java:

1. **Sequence of Elements:** A stream represents a sequence of elements that you can process one at a time. These elements can be of any type, such as numbers, objects, or even other streams.

2. **Lazy Evaluation:** One of the significant features of streams is their lazy evaluation. Operations on a stream are not executed until you trigger a terminal operation. This can lead to more efficient and optimized processing.

3. **Intermediate and Terminal Operations:** Stream operations can be categorized into two types:

   - **Intermediate Operations:** These operations transform the original stream into another stream, allowing you to filter, map, or modify the elements. Examples include `filter`, `map`, and `sorted`.
   - **Terminal Operations:** Terminal operations produce a result or a side effect. They trigger the execution of the stream operations and include operations like `forEach`, `collect`, and `reduce`.

4. **Functional Style:** Stream operations are often used in a functional programming style. This encourages writing concise and readable code, as you can chain operations together.

Here's an example of using streams to process a list of numbers:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

// Filtering the even numbers and then mapping them to their squares
List<Integer> squaresOfEvenNumbers = numbers.stream()
        .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
        .map(n -> n * n)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

System.out.println(squaresOfEvenNumbers); // Output: [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

In this example, we created a stream from a list of numbers, applied `filter` and `map` intermediate operations to transform the data, and finally collected the result into a list using the `collect` terminal operation.

Streams are particularly useful for simplifying and optimizing data processing tasks, including filtering, mapping, reducing, and more. They are commonly used with collections like lists, sets, and maps, but you can also create streams from other data sources.

### Byte stream

In Java, byte stream classes are used to perform input and output operations on binary data, such as reading and writing raw bytes. These classes are part of the `java.io` package and are typically used for handling non-text data, like images, audio, video, or any other binary files. Byte stream classes are essential for low-level I/O operations. Here are some of the most commonly used byte stream classes in Java:

1. **`FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`:** These classes are used to read from and write to files, respectively. They work with binary data and are commonly used for reading and writing bytes to and from files.

   - `FileInputStream` is used to read bytes from a file.
   - `FileOutputStream` is used to write bytes to a file.

   Example of reading from a file:

   ```java
   FileInputStream input = new FileInputStream("input.dat");
   int data;
   while ((data = input.read()) != -1) {
       // Process the byte data
   }
   input.close();
   ```

   Example of writing to a file:

   ```java
   FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream("output.dat");
   byte[] data = {65, 66, 67, 68}; // A, B, C, D in ASCII
   output.write(data);
   output.close();
   ```

These are some of the commonly used byte stream classes in Java. They are essential for working with binary data and performing low-level I/O operations on files and in-memory byte arrays.
Certainly, let's delve into more detail about `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream` in Java.

**FileInputStream:**

1. **Purpose:** `FileInputStream` is a class in Java used for reading bytes from a file. It is typically used when you need to read binary data, such as images, audio files, or any other non-textual information stored in a file.

2. **Construction:** You create an instance of `FileInputStream` by providing the path to the file you want to read from. For example:

   ```java
   FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("example.dat");
   ```

3. **Reading:** You can read bytes from the file using various read methods provided by `FileInputStream`. The most commonly used method is `read()`, which reads a single byte from the file and returns an integer, representing the byte's value. If the end of the file is reached, it returns -1.

   ```java
   int byteValue;
   while ((byteValue = inputStream.read()) != -1) {
       // Process the byte data
   }
   ```

4. **Closing:** After reading the data, it's important to close the `FileInputStream` to release system resources. You can do this using the `close()` method:

   ```java
   inputStream.close();
   ```

**FileOutputStream:**

1. **Purpose:** `FileOutputStream` is a class used for writing bytes to a file. It's often employed to create or overwrite files with binary data.

2. **Construction:** To create an instance of `FileOutputStream`, you provide the path to the file you want to write to. You can specify whether the file should be created anew or appended to if it already exists:

   ```java
   FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("output.dat");
   ```

   To append to an existing file:

   ```java
   FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("output.dat", true);
   ```

3. **Writing:** You can write bytes to the file using the `write()` method provided by `FileOutputStream`. It takes an integer value, which represents the byte to be written. You can also write an array of bytes:

   ```java
   outputStream.write(65); // Writes the byte value 65, which represents 'A' in ASCII
   byte[] data = {66, 67, 68}; // B, C, D in ASCII
   outputStream.write(data);
   ```

4. **Closing:** It's important to close the `FileOutputStream` after writing data to ensure the data is flushed and the file is saved properly:

   ```java
   outputStream.close();
   ```

Remember that when working with file streams, it's essential to handle potential exceptions, such as `IOException`, which can occur during file operations. It's good practice to use a `try-with-resources` block to automatically close the streams and handle exceptions effectively. Additionally, always ensure that you close both input and output streams after you're done with them to prevent resource leaks.

### Character stream class

In Java, character stream classes are used for handling character data, such as text, in a character-oriented way. Character stream classes are part of the `java.io` package and are designed for reading and writing text-based data, including characters and strings. They are especially important when dealing with text files, configuration files, and other text-based input and output operations. Here are some of the most commonly used character stream classes in Java:

1. **`FileReader` and `FileWriter`:** These classes are used for reading and writing text files, where characters are represented as Unicode characters. They are commonly used for text-based I/O operations.

   - `FileReader` is used to read characters from a file.
   - `FileWriter` is used to write characters to a file.

   Example of reading from a file using `FileReader`:

   ```java
   FileReader reader = new FileReader("input.txt");
   int data;
   while ((data = reader.read()) != -1) {
       // Process the character data
   }
   reader.close();
   ```

   Example of writing to a file using `FileWriter`:

   ```java
   FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("output.txt");
   writer.write("Hello, World!");
   writer.close();
   ```

Certainly, let's provide a more detailed explanation of `FileReader` and `FileWriter` in Java, which are used for reading and writing characters to and from a file.

**FileReader:**

1. **Purpose:** `FileReader` is a class in Java used for reading characters from a file. It is specifically designed for reading text files, where characters are represented as Unicode characters. You use it when you need to process textual data from a file.

2. **Construction:** To create an instance of `FileReader`, you provide the path to the file you want to read from:

   ```java
   FileReader reader = new FileReader("textfile.txt");
   ```

3. **Reading Characters:** You can read characters from the file using various read methods provided by `FileReader`. The most commonly used method is `read()`, which reads a single character from the file and returns an integer representing the character's Unicode value. If the end of the file is reached, it returns -1.

   ```java
   int charValue;
   while ((charValue = reader.read()) != -1) {
       char character = (char) charValue; // Convert the integer to a character
       // Process the character data
   }
   ```

4. **Closing:** After reading the data, it's important to close the `FileReader` to release system resources and ensure that the file is properly closed. You can do this using the `close()` method:

   ```java
   reader.close();
   ```

**FileWriter:**

1. **Purpose:** `FileWriter` is a class used for writing characters to a file. It's typically used to create or overwrite text files, allowing you to write textual data to a file.

2. **Construction:** To create an instance of `FileWriter`, you provide the path to the file you want to write to. You can specify whether the file should be created anew or appended to if it already exists:

   ```java
   FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("output.txt");
   ```

   To append to an existing file:

   ```java
   FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("output.txt", true);
   ```

3. **Writing Characters:** You can write characters to the file using the `write()` method provided by `FileWriter`. It accepts a character or a string:

   ```java
   writer.write('A'); // Writes a single character
   writer.write("Hello, World!"); // Writes a string
   ```

4. **Flushing and Closing:** After writing the data, it's a good practice to flush the data to the file using the `flush()` method, ensuring that the data is written immediately. Then, close the `FileWriter` to release resources and ensure the file is properly saved:

   ```java
   writer.flush();
   writer.close();
   ```

When working with file readers and writers, it's important to handle potential exceptions, such as `IOException`, which can occur during file operations. It's a best practice to use a `try-with-resources` block to automatically close the streams and handle exceptions effectively. Additionally, always ensure that you close both input and output streams after you're done with them to prevent resource leaks.

### String tokenizer Class

In Java, the `StringTokenizer` class is a legacy class that is used to break a string into tokens or smaller parts, based on a specified delimiter or set of delimiters. It's part of the `java.util` package. While `StringTokenizer` is still available in Java, it's considered somewhat outdated, and in most cases, it's recommended to use the `String.split()` method or regular expressions for string splitting, as they provide more flexibility and are more versatile.

Here's how you can use the `StringTokenizer` class:

1. **Create an Instance of `StringTokenizer`:** You can create an instance of `StringTokenizer` by passing the input string and the delimiter(s) as parameters to its constructor.

   ```java
   String input = "apple,banana,cherry";
   StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(input, ",");
   ```

2. **Retrieve Tokens:** You can use methods like `nextToken()` to retrieve the individual tokens one by one. The default delimiter is a space.

   ```java
   while (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {
       String token = tokenizer.nextToken();
       System.out.println(token);
   }
   ```

3. **Specify Delimiters:** You can specify multiple delimiters by providing them as a string. For example, to split a string using both comma and semicolon as delimiters:

   ```java
   StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(input, ",;");
   ```

4. **Count Tokens:** You can use the `countTokens()` method to get the number of remaining tokens.

   ```java
   int tokenCount = tokenizer.countTokens();
   System.out.println("Remaining tokens: " + tokenCount);
   ```

Here's a complete example:

```java
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class StringTokenizerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "apple,banana,cherry";
        StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(input, ",");

        while (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {
            String token = tokenizer.nextToken();
            System.out.println(token);
        }
    }
}
```

This code will split the input string into tokens separated by commas and print each token.

It's important to note that the `StringTokenizer` class doesn't provide as much flexibility as `String.split()` or regular expressions. Therefore, if you need more advanced string splitting or if you are working with regular expressions, you should consider using those methods instead for better control and functionality.

## Exception handling

### Intro

- Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event which occur during the execution of a program ie at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of program
- Exception handling in Java is a mechanism used to deal with runtime errors or exceptional conditions that can occur during the execution of a Java program. These exceptional conditions, known as exceptions, can be caused by various factors, such as incorrect input, hardware failures, or unexpected situations in the program's logic. Exception handling allows Java programs to gracefully handle these exceptions and prevent them from causing the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

Key components of exception handling in Java include:

1. **Try**: The `try` block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. If an exception occurs within the `try` block, it is caught and processed in the corresponding `catch` block.

2. **Catch**: The `catch` block is used to handle or catch exceptions that are thrown within the `try` block. Each `catch` block specifies the type of exception it can catch. If an exception matches the type specified in a `catch` block, that block is executed to handle the exception.

3. **Throw**: The `throw` statement is used to explicitly throw an exception when a specific condition is met. This allows you to create custom exceptions or rethrow exceptions with more context.

4. **Finally**: The `finally` block is optional and follows the `try` and `catch` blocks. It is executed whether an exception is thrown or not. It is often used to release resources, such as closing files or database connections, to ensure that cleanup tasks are performed.

Here is a simple example of exception handling in Java:

```java
try {
    // Code that may cause an exception
    int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw an ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    // Handle the exception
    System.out.println("An arithmetic exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
    // This block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
    System.out.println("Finally block executed.");
}
```

In this example, if an `ArithmeticException` is thrown (e.g., due to division by zero), it is caught in the `catch` block, and a message is printed. The `finally` block is executed in any case.

Java has a hierarchy of built-in exception classes, which include checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. Checked exceptions must be either caught (using a `try-catch` block) or declared in the method signature using the `throws` keyword. Unchecked exceptions (usually subclasses of `RuntimeException`) do not need to be explicitly caught or declared.

Effective exception handling is an essential aspect of writing robust and reliable Java programs. It allows you to gracefully handle errors and failures, making your applications more user-friendly and resilient.

### difference b/w exception and error

### Checked vs unchecked exception

- Wrong Concept:- Compile time exception occurs at compile time and runtime exception occur at runtime
- Right concept:- All exception occur at runtime
  ![](../../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020231023102701.png)
- Checked exception:- exception which the compiler can check (here the program is not compiled but compiler beforehand warning about these before compiling)
- Unchecked Exception:-

In Java, exceptions are categorized into two main types: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. The primary differences between these two categories are related to handling requirements and the nature of the exceptions:

**Checked Exceptions:**

1. **Compilation Requirement**:

   - Checked exceptions must be either caught (using a `try-catch` block) or declared in the method signature using the `throws` keyword.
   - If you call a method that declares a checked exception, you must either catch the exception or declare it in your own method's signature.

2. **Examples**:

   - Common checked exceptions include `IOException`, `SQLException`, and `ClassNotFoundException`.
   - These exceptions typically represent external factors beyond the programmer's control, such as I/O errors, database connectivity issues, or class loading problems.

3. **Use Case**:
   - Checked exceptions are used for conditions that can be anticipated and reasonably recovered from in the code.
   - They are typically used for situations where the programmer can take corrective actions or provide alternative solutions.

**Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions):**

1. **Compilation Requirement**:

   - Unchecked exceptions (runtime exceptions) do not require explicit handling (i.e., a `try-catch` block or `throws` declaration).
   - You can catch unchecked exceptions, but it's not mandatory, and you can choose not to handle them.

2. **Examples**:

   - Common unchecked exceptions include `NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException`, and `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
   - These exceptions often result from programming errors, such as attempting to access a `null` reference, dividing by zero, or accessing an array out of bounds.

3. **Use Case**:
   - Unchecked exceptions are typically used for programming errors and conditions that are not reasonably recoverable within the code.
   - They signal situations where the program should be fixed, such as null pointer dereferences or array bounds violations.

In summary, the key difference between checked and unchecked exceptions is how they are handled in code. Checked exceptions are enforced at compile-time, requiring explicit handling, and they are typically used for recoverable external conditions. Unchecked exceptions do not require explicit handling, and they are often used for programming errors that should be addressed by fixing the code itself.

### Custom exception

In Java, you can create your own custom exceptions by defining a new class that extends one of the existing exception classes or, more commonly, the `Exception` class. Creating custom exceptions allows you to handle specific error conditions in your application that are not adequately covered by built-in exceptions. Here's how you can define and use a user-defined exception in Java:

1. **Create a User-Defined Exception Class**:

   You can create your own exception class by extending `Exception`, `RuntimeException`, or any other exception class based on your needs. It's common to extend the base `Exception` class for checked exceptions or the `RuntimeException` class for unchecked exceptions. Here's an example of a custom checked exception:

   ```java
   public class CustomCheckedException extends Exception {
       public CustomCheckedException(String message) {
       // super keyword used to call parent class constructor
           super(message);
       }
   }
   ```

   And here's an example of a custom unchecked exception:

   ```java
   public class CustomUncheckedException extends RuntimeException {
       public CustomUncheckedException(String message) {
           super(message);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Throwing the Custom Exception**:

   You can throw your custom exception using the `throw` keyword when a specific condition is met. For example:

   ```java
   public class Example {
       public void doSomething() throws CustomCheckedException {
           if (/* some condition */) {
               throw new CustomCheckedException("A custom checked exception occurred");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Catching the Custom Exception**:

   To catch and handle your custom exception, use a `try-catch` block:

   ```java
   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           try {
               Example example = new Example();
               example.doSomething();
           } catch (CustomCheckedException e) {
               System.out.println("Custom exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Optional: Defining Unchecked Custom Exceptions**:

   If you want your custom exception to be unchecked (i.e., a subclass of `RuntimeException`), you can omit the `throws` declaration and catch it where necessary. Unchecked exceptions do not require explicit handling. Here's an example:

   ```java
   public class Example {
       public void doSomething() {
           if (/* some condition */) {
               throw new CustomUncheckedException("A custom unchecked exception occurred");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

Creating custom exceptions can help you make your code more self-explanatory and handle specific error conditions in a way that is meaningful for your application. Make sure to choose between checked and unchecked custom exceptions based on whether you expect the exceptions to be recoverable or indicate programming errors.

### Try , catch and finally

In Java, the `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks are used in the context of exception handling to handle exceptions gracefully and ensure that certain actions are taken regardless of whether an exception is thrown. Here's an overview of each block and their roles in exception handling:

1. **`try` Block**:

   - The `try` block is used to enclose the code that may throw an exception. It is followed by one or more `catch` blocks.
   - If an exception is thrown within the `try` block, the program will immediately jump to the appropriate `catch` block to handle the exception.

   ```java
   try {
       // Code that may throw an exception
   } catch (ExceptionType1 e1) {
       // Handle ExceptionType1
   } catch (ExceptionType2 e2) {
       // Handle ExceptionType2
   }
   ```

2. **`catch` Block**:

   - `catch` blocks are used to handle exceptions that are thrown within the corresponding `try` block.
   - Each `catch` block specifies the type of exception it can catch. If an exception matches the type, the code in that `catch` block is executed.

   ```java
   try {
       // Code that may throw an exception
   } catch (ExceptionType1 e1) {
       // Handle ExceptionType1
   } catch (ExceptionType2 e2) {
       // Handle ExceptionType2
   }
   ```

3. **`finally` Block**:

   - The `finally` block is optional and follows the `try` and `catch` blocks.
   - The code in the `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.
   - It is often used to perform cleanup operations, such as closing resources (e.g., files, database connections), releasing acquired resources, or ensuring that certain actions are taken no matter what.

   ```java
   try {
       // Code that may throw an exception
   } catch (ExceptionType e) {
       // Handle the exception
   } finally {
       // This block is executed whether an exception occurred or not
       // Perform cleanup or other necessary actions
   }
   ```

Here's a simple example that demonstrates the use of `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ExceptionHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File file = new File("nonexistent.txt");
        FileReader reader = null;

        try {
            reader = new FileReader(file);
            // Code that reads from the file
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An IOException occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            try {
                if (reader != null) {
                    reader.close(); // Close the file reader in the finally block
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("An error occurred while closing the file: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, if the file "nonexistent.txt" does not exist, it will throw an `IOException`. The `catch` block handles this exception, and the `finally` block ensures that the file reader is closed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This is a common pattern for resource cleanup in exception handling.
