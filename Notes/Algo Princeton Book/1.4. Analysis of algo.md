## Simplefication 1: Cost model
- Use some basic operation as a proxy for running time 
- Generally it is the one which is taking the most time 
- for example taking array access as proxy in 2-sum problem

## Simplification 2: Tilde Notation
- Estimate running time as a function of input size N
- Ignore lower ordering items
	- when N is large, terms are negligible 
	- when N is small , we don't care

### Order of growth
- only a limited number of function to describe the time complexity
- 1,logN , NlogN , N<sup>2</sup> , N<sup>3</sup> , 2<sup>N</sup>

## Type of analysis 
### Best case
- lower bound of cost 
- determined by easiest input 
- provide a goal for all inputs 

### Worst case 
- Upper bound on cost 
- Determined by most difficult input 
- provide a guarantee for all inputs

### Average case
- expected cost for random input 
- Need model for random input 
- provides a way to predict performance
