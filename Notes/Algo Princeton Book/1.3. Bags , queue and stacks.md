## Generics 
Generics in Java are a powerful feature that allows you to write reusable and type-safe code. They were introduced in Java 5 to provide compile-time type checking and enable you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on types as parameters, rather than on specific concrete types. Here are some key notes and concepts about generics in Java:

1. **Type Safety**: Generics enable you to catch type errors at compile time rather than at runtime, making your code more reliable and easier to maintain.

2. **Generic Classes**: You can create generic classes by adding type parameters inside angle brackets ("< >") after the class name. For example:

    ```java
    public class Box<T> {
        private T value;
    
        public void setValue(T value) {
            this.value = value;
        }
    
        public T getValue() {
            return value;
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Type Parameters**: Type parameters, such as `T` in the example above, act as placeholders for the actual types that will be used when creating instances of the generic class.

4. **Type Inference**: In many cases, Java can infer the type parameter based on the assignment. For example:

    ```java
    Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
    ```

    Here, Java infers that `T` should be `String` based on the left-hand side of the assignment.

5. **Generic Methods**: You can also create generic methods within non-generic classes or generic classes. Here's an example:

    ```java
    public <T> T genericMethod(T[] array) {
        if (array.length > 0) {
            return array[0];
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }
    ```

6. **Wildcards**: Wildcards allow you to represent an unknown type within a generic class or method. The wildcard symbol `?` is used, and there are three types of wildcards: `? extends T`, `? super T`, and `?`.

7. **Bounded Type Parameters**: You can restrict the types that can be used as type parameters by using bounded type parameters. For example, `T extends Number` means `T` must be a subtype of `Number`.

8. **Generic Interfaces**: You can define generic interfaces, which work similarly to generic classes but can be implemented by various classes with different type parameters.

9. **Type Erasure**: Java uses type erasure to implement generics. This means that generic type information is mostly removed during compilation and does not exist at runtime. This was done to maintain backward compatibility with pre-Java 5 code.

10. **Common Use Cases**: Generics are commonly used in collections (e.g., `List<T>`), as well as in classes like `Optional<T>` and utility classes that work with various types.

11. **Unchecked and Raw Types**: You can still use raw types (e.g., `List` instead of `List<String>`) and suppress unchecked warnings, but it's generally discouraged as it undermines type safety.

12. **Type Parameter Naming**: While `T` is a commonly used name for type parameters, you can use any valid Java identifier as a type parameter name.

Generics in Java are a fundamental concept that helps you write more flexible and robust code. They are widely used in libraries, frameworks, and everyday Java programming to create reusable and type-safe components.

## Wrapper class and autoboxing and auto-unboxing
Wrapper classes in Java are a set of classes that provide a way to represent primitive data types (like `int`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.) as objects. Each primitive data type in Java has a corresponding wrapper class, and these classes are part of the `java.lang` package. The primary reasons for the existence of wrapper classes in Java are as follows:

1. **Object-Oriented Compatibility**: Java is an object-oriented language, and in object-oriented programming, everything is an object. However, primitive data types are not objects in the traditional sense. To make primitive data types compatible with Java's object-oriented model, wrapper classes were introduced. Wrapper classes allow you to treat primitive types as objects.

2. **Nullable Types**: Primitive data types cannot represent null values. Wrapper classes, on the other hand, can represent null because they are objects. This is especially useful when dealing with data from sources where values might be missing.

3. **Generics**: Generics in Java work only with objects, not with primitive data types. If you need to use a primitive type with generics, you can use its corresponding wrapper class. For example, you can use `Integer` instead of `int` in a generic data structure.

4. **Collection Framework**: Java's Collection framework (e.g., `List`, `Set`, `Map`) can only store objects, not primitive types. Wrapper classes allow you to store primitive values in collections.

5. **Methods for Conversion and Manipulation**: Wrapper classes provide methods for converting between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper objects. For example, `Integer.parseInt(String)` converts a `String` to an `int`, and `Integer.toString(int)` converts an `int` to a `String`. These classes also provide methods for common operations on primitive values.

Here are some common wrapper classes and their corresponding primitive data types:

- `Integer`: Corresponds to `int`
- `Double`: Corresponds to `double`
- `Boolean`: Corresponds to `boolean`
- `Character`: Corresponds to `char`
- `Byte`: Corresponds to `byte`
- `Short`: Corresponds to `short`
- `Long`: Corresponds to `long`
- `Float`: Corresponds to `float`

Example of using wrapper classes:

```java
// Using Integer wrapper class
Integer x = 10; // Autoboxing (converting int to Integer)
int y = x;      // Unboxing (converting Integer to int)

// Using Boolean wrapper class
Boolean isJavaFun = true;

// Using Character wrapper class
Character grade = 'A';

// Using Double wrapper class
Double pi = 3.14159265359;
```

In summary, wrapper classes in Java are needed to bridge the gap between primitive data types and objects, allowing you to work with primitive types in an object-oriented way, handle null values, and use them effectively in generic and collection-based operations.
```java
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
stack.push(17);
// auto-boxing (int -> Integer)
int i = stack.pop(); // auto-unboxing (Integer -> int)
```
Automatically casting a primitive type to a wrapper type is known as autoboxing, and
automatically casting a wrapper type to a primitive type is known as auto-unboxing.
In this example, Java automatically casts (autoboxes) the primitive value 17 to be of
type Integer when we pass it to the push() method. The pop() method returns an
Integer, which Java casts (auto-unboxes) to an int before assigning it to the variable i.

## Bags
A bag is a collection where removing items is not supported—its purpose is to
provide clients with the ability to collect items and then to iterate through the collected
items (the client can also test if a bag is empty and find its number of items). The order
of iteration is unspecified and should be immaterial to the client

## Queue 
to preserve there relative order 
### Implementation of queue in java
As we have discussed above that the Queue is an interface, therefore we can also say that the queue cannot be instantiated because interfaces cannot be instantiated. If a user wants to implement the functionality of the Queue interface in Java, then it is mandatory to have some solid classes that implement the Queue interface.

In Java programming language, there are two different classes which are used to implement the Queue interface. These classes are:
- LinkedList
- PriorityQueue
- ArrayDeque
- Other than these two, there is a class that is, Array Blocking Queue that is used to implement the Queue interface.
- There are two types of queues, Unbounded queues and Bounded queues. The Queues that are a part of the java.util package are known as the Unbounded queues and bounded queues are the queues that are present in java.util.concurrent package.
- The Deque or (double-ended queue) is also a type of queue that carries the inclusion and deletion of elements from both ends.
- The deque is also considered thread-safe.
- Blocking Queues are also one of the types of queues that are also thread-safe. The Blocking Queues are used to implement the producer-consumer queries.
- Blocking Queues do not support null elements. In Blocking queues, if any work similar to null values is tried, then the NullPointerException is also thrown.
### interface used in implementation of queue 
The Java interfaces are also used in the implementation of the Java queue. The interfaces that are used to implement the functionalities of the queue are given as follows:
![[Pasted image 20231009161045.png]]

![[Pasted image 20231009161128.png]]

### Java queue array implementation
Queue implementation is not as straightforward as a stack implementation.

To implement queue using Arrays, we first declare an array that holds n number of elements.

Then we define the following operations to be performed in this queue.

**1) Enqueue:** An operation to insert an element in the queue is Enqueue (function queue Enqueue in the program). For inserting an element at the rear end, we need first to check if the queue is full. If it is full, then we cannot insert the element. If rear < n, then we insert the element in the queue.

**2) Dequeue:** The operation to delete an element from the queue is Dequeue (function queue Dequeue in the program). First, we check whether the queue is empty. For dequeue operation to work, there has to be at least one element in the queue.

**3) Front:** This method returns the front of the queue.

**4) Display:** This method traverses the queue and displays the elements of the queue.
## Stack 
- follow principle of LIFO
### Stack in java
- In Java, **Stack** is a class that falls under the Collection framework that extends the **Vector** class. It also implements interfaces **List, Collection, Iterable, Cloneable, Serializable.** It represents the LIFO stack of objects. Before using the Stack class, we must import the java.util package. The stack class arranged in the Collections framework hierarchy, as shown below.
- ![[Pasted image 20231009155831.png]]

### Creating stack 
`Stack<type> stk = new Stack<>();`

### Methods of stack class 
We can perform push, pop, peek and search operation on the stack. The Java Stack class provides mainly five methods to perform these operations. Along with this, it also provides all the methods of the Java Vector class

![[Pasted image 20231009160029.png]]

`Stack.size()`

### Iterator elements 
Iterate means to fetch the elements of the stack. We can fetch elements of the stack using three different methods are as follows:

- Using **iterator()** Method
	- It is the method of the Iterator interface. It returns an iterator over the elements in the stack. Before using the iterator() method import the java.util.Iterator package.
```java
Iterator iterator = stk.iterator();  
while(iterator.hasNext()){  
  Object values = iterator.next();  
  System.out.println(values);   
}
```
- Using **forEach()** Method
	- Java provides a forEach() method to iterate over the elements. The method is defined in the **Iterable** and **Stream** interface.
```java
stk.forEach(n -> {  
System.out.println(n);  
});
```
- Using **listIterator()** Method
- 
## Implementation of collection 
### Array resizing 
- representing stack as array 
- but as we know that array cannot be resized after declaration then with every push() call we have to check if the length is available and if not then declare array 2 twice the size and move all those element to new array . similarly with pop()  we can check if array is not too much empty then we can declare a small array and move element there.
- the appropriate test
is whether the stack size is less than one-fourth the array size. After the array is halved,
it will be about half full and can accommodate a substantial number of push() and
pop() operations before having to change the size of the array again.

### Loitering
Java’s garbage collection policy is to reclaim the memory associated with
any objects that can no longer be accessed. In our pop() implementations, the refer-
ence to the popped item remains in the array. The item is effectively an orphan—it will
be never be accessed again—but the Java garbage collector has no way to know this
until it is overwritten. Even when the client is done with the item, the reference in the
array may keep it alive. This condition (holding a reference to an item that is no longer
needed) is known as loitering.

In this case, loitering is easy to avoid, by setting the array
entry corresponding to the popped item to null, thus overwriting the unused refer-
ence and making it possible for the system to reclaim the memory associated with the
popped item when the client is finished with it.

### Linked list 
A linked list is a recursive data structure that is either empty (null) or a
reference to a node having a generic item and a reference to a linked list.
The node in this definition is an abstract entity that might hold any kind of data, in ad-
dition to the node reference that characterizes its role in building linked lists

![[Pasted image 20231002123709.png]]
- we can also achieve this task using array but in linked list it is easier to insert item
#### Inserting at beginning 
to insert the string not at the beginning of a given linked list whose first node is first, we save first in oldfirst, assign to first a new Node, and assign its item field to not and its
next field to oldfirst. This code for inserting a node at the beginning of a linked list
involves just a few assignment statements, so the amount of time that it takes is inde-
pendent of the length of the list

![[Pasted image 20231002124214.png]]
#### Removing from beginning 
simply assign to first the value first.next. Normally, you would retrieve the value of the item (by assigning it to some variable of type Item) before doing this assignment, because once you change the value of first, you may not have any access to the node to which it was referring. Typically, the node object becomes an orphan, and the Java memory management system eventually reclaims the memory it occupies. Again, this operation just involves one assignment statement, so its running time is independent of the length of the list.

*here important thing to note that java manage memory automatically but this approach not suitable for language like C , C++*

#### Insert at end

### Using linked list for stack implementation and Queue 

## Data structure 
- Up until now(what i have read in this book) we have two ways to store objects . Array and linked list , one allows sequential allocation and other one linked allocation

|data structure      | +ve      | -ve    |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Array      |  index provide immediate access to item    | need to know size on initialisation     |
|Linked List      | use space proportional to size     | need reference to access item     |

## Priority Queue 
A priority queue is ADt that operates similar to a normal queue except that each element has a certain priority. The Priority of elements in the PQ determine the order in which elements are removed from the PQ

PQ only supports comparable data , meaning the data inserted into the PQ must be able to be ordered in some way either from least to greatest or greatest to least . this is so that we are able to assign relative priorities to each element 
it use heap data structure to implement the sorting process
#### What is heap
- a tree based DS that satisfies the heap invariant: if A is a parent node of B then A is ordered with represct to B for all nodes A, B in the heap.
- It can be max heap and min heap
![[Pasted image 20231004132900.png]]

## Binary tree 
- empty or node with links to left and right binary tree 
- complete binary tree is perfectly balanced , except for bottom level
- property of complete tree :- height of complete tree with N nodes
- height only increase when N is a power of 2
- left child of k node is 2`*`k and right chlid is 2`*`k + 1
![[Pasted image 20231006203713.png]]
- in reality there is no requirement of links for binary tree , it is represented as array in memory we are just applying some arthmetic on the indices to get the child nodes 
- parent of node k is at k/2

#### What is heap
- Suppose H is a complete binary tree with n elements, H is called heap , if each node N of H has following properties
	- The value of N is greater than to the value at each of children of N than it is called Max heap 
	- A min heap is defined as the value at N is less than the value at any of the children of N
- Promotion in heap
	- exchange key in child with key in parent 
	- repeat until heap is restored 
```java
private void promotion(int k){
  while(k > 1 && less(k/2, k)){
    exch(k/2 , k);
    k = k/2;
  }
}
```
- Insertion in heap
	- first inserting 
	- then checking if it is smaller than parent using above promotion function
- Demotion
	- exchange key in parent with key in larger child
	- repeat until heap is restored 
- Deletion 
	- Exchange root with end node and then sink it down

### PQ implemetation cost summary
![[Pasted image 20231009065505.png]]

### heapSort 
- Sorting algorithm implemented using heap data structure
- ![[Pasted image 20231009070346.png]]
- in sorting 
	- we exchange the largest key (which is root) with the last key . then after exchange we perform max heap operation on the heap
	- ![[Pasted image 20231009071208.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231009071230.png]]
	- the largest element X is off the heap (meaning not considered for further calculation)
	- now we perform max heap operation on E 
- ![[Pasted image 20231009071805.png]]

## Linked List 
### in java
Java LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements. It provides a linked-list data structure. It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.

The important points about Java LinkedList are:

- Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements.
- Java LinkedList class maintains insertion order.
- Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
- In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to occur.
- Java LinkedList class can be used as a list, stack or queue.
