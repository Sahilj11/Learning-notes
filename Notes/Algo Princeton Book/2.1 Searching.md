## Symbol tables 
We use the term symbol table to describe an abstract mechanism where we save in-
formation (a value) that we can later search for and retrieve by specifying a key

There can be a huge number of keys and a huge amount of information, so implementing an efficient symbol table is a significant computational challenge.

Symbol tables are sometimes called dictionaries, or indices
we consider three classic data structures that can support efficient symbol-table implementations:binary search trees, red-black trees, and hash tables

To implement a symbol table, we need to define an un-
derlying data structure and then specify algorithms for insert, search, and other opera-
tions that create and manipulate the data structure.

- Handeling duplication in ST
- When a client puts a key-value pair into a table already containing that key (and
	an associated value), the new value replaces the old one.
- Null keys. Keys must not be null. As with many mechanisms in Java, use of a null key
results in an exception at runtime
- Null values. We also adopt the convention that no key can be associated with the value
null.
- Deletion. Deletion in symbol tables generally involves one of two strategies: lazy dele-
tion, where we associate keys in the table with null, then perhaps remove all such keys
at some later time; and eager deletion, where we remove the key from the table imme-
diately.
- Key equality:- Determining whether or not a given key is in a symbol table is based on
the concept of object equality, which we discussed at length in Section 1.2 (see page
102). Javaâ€™s convention that all objects inherit an equals() method and its implementa-
tion of equals() both for standard types and complicated type
