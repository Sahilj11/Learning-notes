### Network vs host portion
- taking an anology of going to a address , when we want to go to a destination , first we look for street name and when we reach that street we look for house number .
- so here the network address is the street name 
- and host address are house number 
- router route traffic to a destination network and when they get to destination network (routing protocol). IP address are used to reach the device 
- in a network same host portion cannot be present 
- router take decision related to path based on network addresses
- router routing table is not populated with ip address but with network address

## Address classes
- classless inter domain routing (CIDR) rightnow it is followed . meaning classes are not used for routing 
- before CIDR ip address were divided b/w 5 classes
	- A:- unicast traffic
	- B :- unicast traffic 
	- C :- unicast traffic 
	- D :- multicast
	- E :- reserved for future or experimental purposes

### Special address 
- Directed broadcast address:- used by host to send data to all devices on a specfic network
	- binary 1s in the entire host portion of address 
	- directed broadcast of 172.31.0.0 :- 172.31.255.255
	- routers can route directed broadcast :- broadcast address forwarding is disabled by default . as hacker can use the broadcast address forwarding for a dos attack. because data from broadcast address are send to all host in a network and it can interupt the working of a host pc , if too many request are been sent
- Local Broadcast address:- communicate with all devices on local network
	- address is all binary 1s :- 255.255.255.255
	- host request an IP address from a DHCP server
		- Dynamic host configuration protocol :- it is a service that provides ip address dynamically to devices in a network . so that network admin do not have to manual assign static ip.
	- local broadcast address are always dropped by routers . but it can be allowed using DHCP forwarding or DHCP relay. when the pc and DHCP server are in different network
	- even after configuring router for DHCP forwarding they still blocks the broadcast but instead act as a proxy for the requesting pc and sends a unicast dhcp request to dHCP server.
- Local loopback address:- used to let a system send a message to itself for testing 
	- this is very useful to make sure that the TCP/IP stack is correctly installed on machine
		- typicall loopback address is 127.0.0.1 . anything in the 127 range is considered a loopback address . (meaning from 127.0.0.1 to 127.127.127.127) all are loopback address . which made 16 million address as loopback address . and these address cannot be used as public address
	- routers have loopback addresses which are not same as local loopback address. loopback interface generally 10.1.1.1/32
- Private address (RFC 1918)
	- non routable ip address. these are blocked by ISP and thus cannot be used to request on the internet
	- reserved ip addresses for private ip
		- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
		- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
		- 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
	- meaning that if a request is made to lets say google.com then first the private ip will be NAT (Network address translation) to a public ip so that it can be routed on internet
- IPv4 link - local address 
	- used when pc configured for DHCP but when no server is available. so pc automatically choose ip
		- range 169.254.0.0/16
		- allow two computers to communicate when there are no DHCP server available
		- can immediately communicate without configuration
		- host randomly generate host specific part of the address
		- be careful of this address range , it will not be routed
### Subnet mask 
- it used to determine which part of ip is network portion and which is host portion
- this allow the pc to know the device we want to communicate is a local device or a host device
- if same subnet no use of default gateway and traffic directly send,  but if subnet is not same then traffic set to default gateway which will do inter-VLAN routing (if they are on local LAN) or route the traffic to router 

## CIDR (Classless inter-domain routing)
- replaces classful IP addressing 
- allow us to use variable length subnet mask(VLSM)
	- use:- 10.0.0.0/8 notation
	- rather than :- 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 notation
	- just an another way of writing subnet mask
	
CIDR, which stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing, is a method of IP (Internet Protocol) addressing and IP routing that was introduced to overcome some of the limitations of the older classful IP addressing scheme. CIDR significantly changed the IP addressing paradigm by allowing for more flexible and efficient allocation of IP addresses.

Here's how CIDR works and how it changed the IP addressing paradigm:

1. **Classful IP Addressing (Before CIDR):**
   - In the early days of the internet, IP addresses were divided into classes: Class A, Class B, and Class C.
   - Each class had a fixed number of network bits and host bits. For example, Class A had 8 network bits and 24 host bits, allowing for many hosts but relatively few networks.
   - This classful system was inefficient because it led to a lot of wasted IP addresses, especially in cases where organizations needed more IP addresses than a class could provide, or fewer than a class offered.

2. **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):**
   - CIDR does away with the rigid class-based system and allows for a more flexible allocation of IP addresses.
   - In CIDR notation, IP addresses are represented with a prefix length, denoted by "/X" (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
   - The prefix length indicates the number of network bits, which can vary, unlike the fixed network bits in classful addressing.
   - CIDR enables the creation of subnets with custom sizes, making it possible to allocate the exact number of IP addresses needed for a network, eliminating IP address wastage.

3. **Hierarchical Routing:**
   - CIDR introduced hierarchical routing, where IP addresses are aggregated into larger blocks with a common prefix. This reduces the size of routing tables on the internet's backbone routers.
   - Routing tables in classful addressing were unwieldy and difficult to manage, especially as the internet grew. CIDR greatly simplifies routing by aggregating routes.

4. **Efficiency and Conservation:**
   - CIDR allows for more efficient allocation of IP addresses, reducing IP address exhaustion. Organizations can request the exact number of addresses they need, which is particularly important given the scarcity of IPv4 addresses.
   - It promotes the conservation of IPv4 addresses, delaying the need for a complete transition to IPv6.

5. **Prefix Summarization:**
   - CIDR enables prefix summarization, which means that multiple smaller address blocks can be summarized into a single larger block for routing purposes. This further reduces the size of routing tables.

In summary, CIDR revolutionized IP addressing by introducing a classless system that provides flexibility in allocating IP addresses, promotes efficient use of address space, simplifies routing, and conserves IP addresses. This paradigm shift was crucial for the continued growth and scalability of the internet as it allowed for more efficient and effective utilization of the limited pool of available IP addresses.
