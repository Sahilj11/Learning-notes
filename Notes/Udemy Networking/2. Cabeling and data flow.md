## type of communication 
- Unicast 
- Broadcast:-  generally these are blocked by layer 3 devices such as switches and routers. in IPv6 broadcast are not supported  
- Multicast :- one to some . only those that subscribe to that receives the traffic (like subscribing to a newsletter)

## Ethernet history 
- In original Ethernet implementation network topology was used a bus 
	- each device connected to a single cable (similar to a telephony environment)
	- when traffic is sent to that cable all the device listen to the traffic 
- Earlier ethernet implementation
	- 10base5:- thicknet
	- 10base2:- thinnet
- 10base2:- use coax cable , max speed of 10 Mbps . in name 10base2 . 10 refer to the speed and 2 referred to maximum segment size(185 meter). base means baseband
	- base band only allow for a single signal to traverse the wire at any given time 
	- broadband allow for multiple signal to send across  a single coax wire at a single point in time 
### More info on 10base2
In a 10BASE2 Ethernet network, also known as Thinnet or Cheapernet, a single collision domain encompasses all devices connected to the same coaxial cable segment. Let's break down what this means:

1. **Collision Domain:** A collision domain is a network segment where network devices share the same communication medium (in this case, a coaxial cable) and can potentially collide when they transmit data at the same time. Collisions occur when two or more devices transmit data simultaneously, leading to data corruption and the need for retransmission.

2. **10BASE2:** This term refers to the specific Ethernet standard used in the network. "10" represents the data transfer rate of 10 Mbps (megabits per second), while "BASE" stands for baseband signaling, indicating that it uses a single frequency for transmission. "2" indicates that the maximum cable length allowed for a segment is 200 meters.

Now, in a 10BASE2 network:

- All devices (computers, printers, etc.) are connected to the same coaxial cable, which runs throughout the network.

- Devices communicate by sending electrical signals over this shared cable.

- Since all devices share the same cable, they are part of the same collision domain.

- Collisions can occur when two or more devices try to transmit data simultaneously. When a collision happens, all devices on the segment detect it and must wait for a random period before attempting to retransmit their data. This process is known as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD).

- To reduce the likelihood of collisions and improve network performance, there are restrictions on the total number of devices and the cable length within a single 10BASE2 segment.

While 10BASE2 was once popular, it has largely been replaced by more modern Ethernet technologies like 10BASE-T (using twisted-pair cables) and 100BASE-TX (Fast Ethernet). These newer standards provide higher speeds and more reliable performance, with fewer concerns about collisions due to advancements like full-duplex communication and switches.
## MAC 
- unique identifier assigned to NIC .
-  It is 48 bits 
- OUI portion :- Org unique identifier , identifies a vendor like cisco , hp . it is 24 bits 
- Station address portion:- it should be unique , it is a 24 bit vendor assigned end station address . although it should be unique but there has been chases it been duplicate . it can cause problem . in a segment all device should have unique MAC address .
- MAC address can be changed using software , this is helpful to tackle issue like duplicate MAC addresses

### CSMA/CD
- Ethernet when a bus topology is used devices uses what is called Carrier sense multi access / collision detection 
- carrier sense :- it allow a device to see if the network is free from traffic or not for its communication
- multi access:- it allow devices to access the bandwidth independently 
- Collision detection: help in detecting the collision and if it happens then JAM signal is send / backoff (like a cooldown)
### Issues with 10base2
- Bandwidth is shared 
- single collision domain
- Single broadcast domain:- if a device sends a broadcast everyone in network will need to process that broadcast . which means cpu needs to stop the work it is doing and process the broadcast message . what if sending devices sends multiple broadcast message
### Due to these issues 10base2 replaced with 10baseT
- it use unshielded twisted pair , max segment size is 100 meter
- may used shielded twisted pair - used in noisy environment 
- UTP(unshielded twisted pair):- 
	- Straight Though cables
	- Cross over cables
#### What is MDI and MDIX
MDI (Medium Dependent Interface) and MDIX (Medium Dependent Interface Crossover) are terms used in Ethernet networking to describe the types of connections used for connecting devices, such as computers, switches, routers, and hubs, using twisted-pair Ethernet cables (usually with RJ-45 connectors).

1. **MDI (Medium Dependent Interface):**
   - MDI refers to the standard wiring used on Ethernet devices like computers, routers, and switches.
   - When connecting two devices of the same type (e.g., computer to computer or switch to switch), you typically use a straight-through Ethernet cable, which follows the MDI wiring standard.
   - In MDI, pins on one end of the cable match directly with the corresponding pins on the other end.

2. **MDIX (Medium Dependent Interface Crossover):**
   - MDIX refers to a crossover version of Ethernet wiring used for connecting devices of different types (e.g., computer to switch or router to switch).
   - When connecting devices of different types, you generally use a crossover Ethernet cable, which follows the MDIX wiring standard.
   - In MDIX, the wiring of the cable crosses over certain pairs of pins, allowing the transmit signals from one device to be connected to the receive pins of the other device and vice versa. This crossover configuration is necessary to ensure that the transmit signals from one device reach the appropriate receive pins on the other device.

In summary, the key difference between MDI and MDIX is the wiring configuration of the Ethernet cable:

- MDI is used for connecting devices of the same type (e.g., computer to computer or switch to switch) and requires a straight-through cable.
- MDIX is used for connecting devices of different types (e.g., computer to switch or router to switch) and requires a crossover cable.

Many modern network devices, such as switches and routers, have Auto-MDIX (Automatic MDI/MDIX) ports, which can automatically detect the type of cable (straight-through or crossover) being used and adjust their wiring accordingly. This feature simplifies network setup, as you can often use any standard Ethernet cable to connect devices without worrying about whether it's a straight-through or crossover cable.

### Cable categories 
- CAT1- was prev used for telephone and modems
- CAT2- was prev used for telephone and data networks 
- CAT3 , CAT4 , CAT5
- all of the above are not used majorly today
- CAT5e- support 1Gbps
- CAT6- support 10Gbps
- CAT 7 - instead of RJ45 it contains tera connector
- DAC(direct attachment cable) copper twinax:- 
- Roll over cable :- to connect to console port of device

## Working of networking device 
### Hubs - 10baseT
- it is important to understand hub as wireless operate same way as hub
- it is physical layer deivce 
- act as Multiport repeater :- broadcast what it receive from one port and repeat to all other ports . it has no intelligence 
- Star topology
- all device's NIC receiving the frame will see the destination address . it destination address is not same to there they will drop the traffic and one having that address will accept it.
- Physical topology :- star
- Logical topology:- bus

### Bridge
- Layer 2 
- Use MAC address table also called CAM table 
	- Content addressible memory:
- Star topology
- Bridge store the MAC table in software where as switches do the processing in hardware (use ASIC , application specific integrated circuit)
- if MAC table is dynamic meaning with time bridge is filling the mac table . key-value pair where key is port number and value is mac-address
- each port is a different collision domain meaning that collision on port 1 will not affect port 3
- Single broadcast domain :- meaning it will be received by all devices
- process frame using software whereas switch process frame in hardware

### Switch 
- process done in hardware using ASICs (application specific integrated circuit)
- support many ports 
- Star topology
- single broadcast domain:- switch flooded broadcast to all port except the receiving one 
- multiple collision domain
- wire speed switching of frames :- means that switching frame from one port to another is same speed as the speed it received the frame

### Router 
- Layer 3 
- routing decision based on IP address
- router still use MAC address on ethernet interface but decision making for routing is still based on IP address
Routers use both MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses for different purposes within a network. These two address types serve distinct functions, and understanding their roles can help clarify how routers use them.

1. MAC Address:
   - MAC addresses are hardware addresses assigned to network interface cards (NICs) at the manufacturing level. They are unique globally and are used for identifying devices on a local network segment, typically within the same physical network (e.g., an Ethernet LAN).
   - Routers use MAC addresses primarily for local network communication. When a packet needs to be sent within a local network segment (e.g., from one device to another on the same LAN), the router uses MAC addresses to direct the packet to the appropriate device.
   - When a packet is sent within a local network, it contains both the source and destination MAC addresses. The router uses these MAC addresses to determine how to forward the packet within the local network.

2. IP Address:
   - IP addresses are logical addresses used to identify devices on a larger scale, such as the global Internet. They are hierarchical and are used for routing packets across different networks.
   - Routers use IP addresses for making routing decisions between different networks. When a packet needs to traverse multiple network segments to reach its destination, routers look at the destination IP address to determine the best path or next hop for forwarding the packet.
   - The router consults its routing table, which contains information about how to reach various IP networks. Based on this information, it decides where to send the packet next.

In summary, routers use MAC addresses for local, Ethernet-based communication within a single network segment. This helps devices on the same local network segment find and communicate with each other. However, when it comes to making routing decisions between different networks, routers rely on IP addresses. IP addresses provide the necessary logical addressing to guide packets across the global Internet and route them to their intended destinations.
