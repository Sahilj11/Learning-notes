## type of communication 
- Unicast 
- Broadcast:-  generally these are blocked by layer 3 devices such as switches and routers. in IPv6 broadcast are not supported  
- Multicast :- one to some . only those that subscribe to that receives the traffic (like subscribing to a newsletter)

## Ethernet history 
- In original Ethernet implementation network topology was used a bus 
	- each device connected to a single cable (similar to a telephony environment)
	- when traffic is sent to that cable all the device listen to the traffic 
- Earlier ethernet implementation
	- 10base5:- thicknet
	- 10base2:- thinnet
- 10base2:- use coax cable , max speed of 10 Mbps . in name 10base2 . 10 refer to the speed and 2 refered to maximum segment size(185 meter). base means baseband
	- base band only allow for a single signal to traverse the wire at any given time 
	- broadband allow for multiple signal to send across  a single coax wire at a single point in time
