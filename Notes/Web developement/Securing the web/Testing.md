# Assert
- In Python, the `assert` statement is used as a debugging tool to check if a given condition is true. If the condition is true, the program continues its execution as normal. However, if the condition is false, an `AssertionError` is raised, indicating that an assumption or expectation in the code has been violated.
```
def square(x):
    return x * x
 assert square(10) == 100   
```
