## Sessions
- Websites can create a session for each user. When you visit a website, the server assigns a unique identifier (session ID) to your session. This session ID is often stored in a cookie or appended to URLs. The server can associate your session ID with specific data, such as items in your shopping cart or your logged-in status. With each subsequent request, the server uses the session ID to retrieve the relevant session data, making it appear as if the website "remembers" your activity.
	- Example of appending the session ID to urls
		- Let's say you're visiting an online shopping website. When you first arrive at the website, the server assigns you a unique session ID to identify your session. This session ID is typically stored in a cookie or can be passed as a parameter appended to the URLs.
		- For instance, let's assume your session ID is "abc123." As you navigate through the website, the session ID may be included in the URLs of different pages. Here's an example:
			- Home Page: URL: [https://example.com/home?session=abc123](https://example.com/home?session=abc123)
			- Product Listing Page: URL: [https://example.com/products?category=electronics&session=abc123](https://example.com/products?category=electronics&session=abc123)
			- Product Detail Page: URL: [https://example.com/product?id=12345&session=abc123](https://example.com/product?id=12345&session=abc123)
		- By appending the session ID to the URLs, the website can keep track of your session as you move from page to page. When you click on a link or make a request, the server recognizes the session ID and knows it's you.
		- This allows the website to maintain your logged-in state, remember items you added to your cart, or display personalized content specific to your session.
		- It's important to note that the session ID in the URL can be encrypted or encoded to ensure security and prevent unauthorized access to sessions.
		- Appending the session ID to URLs is just one way of maintaining session state in a web application. Other techniques, such as using cookies or hidden form fields, are also commonly used to achieve the same purpose
- Let's imagine you're visiting a virtual amusement park website. When you arrive, the website gives you a special ticket called a "session pass." This pass allows you to have a personalized experience while you're at the park.
- With this session pass, the website remembers who you are and keeps track of what you do while you're there. It's like having a virtual guide who knows your preferences and helps you have a fun time.
- Here's how it works:
	- When you enter the website, the server gives you a session pass. This pass has a special code or ID that identifies you during your visit.
	- As you navigate through the website, the server keeps track of your activities using your session pass. It notes which rides you go on, which games you play, and any other actions you take.
	- The session pass also helps the website remember things specific to you. For example, if you select a favorite ride or game, the website will remember it and show you recommendations based on your preferences.
	- The session pass is like a virtual wristband that you wear during your visit. It lets you move freely around the park without having to show your ticket every time or repeat your preferences.
	- As long as you stay on the website, your session pass remains active, and the website continues to remember your activities and preferences.
	- Once you leave the website or close your browser, your session pass expires. The website no longer keeps track of your activities unless you come back and get a new session pass.
- In simple terms, a session on a web application is like having a special ticket that lets the website remember who you are and what you do. It's helpful because it allows the website to provide personalized experiences and recommendations just for you, making your time on the website more enjoyable.
- Remember, sessions are used by websites to make your visit unique and tailored to your interests, just like having a personalized guide in a virtual amusement park

## Cookies

- A cookie is a small text file stored on your web browser by a website you visit. It contains information that the website wants to remember about you for future visits. When you revisit the same website, your browser sends the cookie back to the server, allowing the website to recognize and remember you.
- whenever you visit a website it sends cookie to your browser like a stamp on your hand , every time you click a link on website or make any request the browser present the cookie to website (it is in response headers  as a separate http header [[Basics of internet#HTTP Headers]] `Set-cookie: session=value`)
- A cookie typically consists of the following components:
	- Name: Each cookie has a unique name that identifies it. This name helps the website retrieve and update the cookie when needed.
	- Value: The value is the actual information stored in the cookie. It can be a simple piece of text or a more complex data structure, depending on what the website wants to remember.
	- Expiration Date: Cookies have an expiration date or time set by the website. Once this time passes, the cookie becomes invalid, and your browser will no longer send it to the server. Some cookies may expire when you close your browser (session cookies), while others may have a specific expiration date in the future (persistent cookies).
	- Domain: The domain specifies which website or group of websites the cookie belongs to. It determines which websites can access and retrieve the cookie. For example, a cookie set by example.com will only be sent back to example.com, not to other websites.
	- Path: The path defines the specific URLs within a domain that the cookie is associated with. It allows the cookie to be sent back to the server only when visiting certain pages or directories within the website.
	- Secure Flag: If a cookie has the secure flag set, it will only be sent to the server over a secure (HTTPS) connection. This adds an extra layer of protection for sensitive information.
	- HttpOnly Flag: When a cookie has the HttpOnly flag set, it cannot be accessed or modified by JavaScript on the client-side. This helps protect the cookie from certain types of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
		- The HttpOnly flag is a feature of cookies that provides an extra layer of security. When a cookie has the HttpOnly flag set, it means that the cookie cannot be accessed or modified by JavaScript code running in the web browser.
		- The purpose of the HttpOnly flag is to mitigate certain types of attacks, particularly cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a website, and this code can then manipulate or steal sensitive information stored in cookies
		- By setting the HttpOnly flag, the cookie becomes off-limits to JavaScript, preventing the injected code from accessing or modifying it. This helps protect the integrity and confidentiality of the cookie data.
		- Essentially, the HttpOnly flag ensures that cookies are only accessible through HTTP requests and responses, which are handled by the web server and not directly by JavaScript running in the browser. This prevents attackers from using client-side scripts to read or manipulate sensitive cookie information.
		- It's worth noting that the HttpOnly flag is supported by most modern web browsers, and it is recommended to set this flag for cookies that contain sensitive information, such as session IDs or authentication tokens. However, it's important to remember that the HttpOnly flag alone does not guarantee complete security. Other security measures, such as input validation and secure coding practices, should also be implemented to protect against different types of attacks.
- Cookies can store various types of information, such as login credentials, preferences, shopping cart contents, user activity, or personalized settings. The specific details stored in a cookie depend on what the website wants to remember about you and improve your browsing experience.
- It's important to note that cookies can be controlled and managed by the user. Web browsers allow you to view and delete cookies, block certain cookies, or configure preferences related to their usage for privacy reasons

## Methods
- In HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), methods, also known as HTTP verbs, are used to indicate the type of action that should be performed on a resource. The HTTP protocol defines several standard methods that specify how a client (such as a web browser) and a server should interact with each other. Here are some commonly used HTTP methods: ^573c3e
	- GET: The GET method is used to retrieve a resource from a server. When a client sends a GET request to a server, it is asking the server to send back a representation of the specified resource. For example, when you visit a website by entering a URL in your browser, a GET request is sent to the server to retrieve the corresponding web page.
		- the GET method is the default method used by web browsers when making requests in the browser URL space. When you type a URL into the address bar of your browser and press Enter, the browser will send a GET request to that URL.
		- The GET method is used for retrieving data from a server. It includes the requested resource in the URL itself or as query parameters appended to the URL. For example, when you visit a website like `https://example.com/page`, the browser sends a GET request to the server for the `/page` resource.
		- By default, when you enter a URL in the browser, it assumes that you want to perform a GET request to retrieve the webpage associated with that URL. However, keep in mind that modern web applications often use more advanced techniques, such as AJAX or JavaScript frameworks, to perform requests using other HTTP methods like POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., without explicitly navigating to a new URL.
		- It's worth noting that while GET requests are the default in the browser URL space, web developers can explicitly specify other HTTP methods like POST, PUT, or DELETE using various techniques (e.g., HTML forms with the `method` attribute, JavaScript XHR or Fetch API, etc.) to send requests with those methods.
	- POST: The POST method is used to submit data to be processed by the server. It is commonly used when submitting forms on websites. The data sent in a POST request is typically included in the request body and can be used by the server to create or update a resource. For example, when you fill out a registration form on a website, the form data is sent to the server using a POST request.
		- although POST itself does not provide encryption but in the envelope send to the server from user computer , the POST requests are way below the request headers so that it does not get displayed easily 
	- PUT: The PUT method is used to store or update a resource on the server. It replaces the entire resource with the one sent in the request. If the resource doesn't exist, the server may create it. PUT requests are often used to update existing records or create new ones with a specific identifier.
	- DELETE: The DELETE method is used to remove a specified resource from the server. When a client sends a DELETE request, it instructs the server to delete the identified resource. For example, when you delete a post or a file on a website, a DELETE request is sent to the server.
	- PATCH: The PATCH method is used to partially update a resource on the server. It is similar to the PUT method but only updates specific fields or attributes of the resource, rather than replacing the entire resource. The request includes the changes to be applied, usually in the form of a JSON or XML document.
	- OPTIONS: The OPTIONS method is used to request information about the communication options available for a resource or the server itself. It allows the client to inquire about the allowed methods, headers, and other capabilities of the server.
- These are some of the commonly used HTTP methods, but there are a few more, such as HEAD (retrieves metadata about a resource), TRACE (used for diagnostics and debugging), and CONNECT (used to establish a network connection through a proxy).
- Each HTTP method has a specific purpose and defines the intended action to be performed on a resource. Clients and servers communicate with each other by exchanging requests and responses using these methods, allowing them to interact and manipulate resources over the web.

## Stateless protocol 

- HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that each request is independent of any previous requests. The server does not maintain any information about past requests, and each request is treated as a separate transaction.
		- Explaining stateless protocol
			- imagine you're playing a game with your friend. In this game, you both take turns doing different actions. But here's the catch: every time it's your turn, you have to start from scratch and explain everything from the beginning. You can't remember what happened before or what your friend did. You only know what's happening at that exact moment. 
			- Well, that's kind of how a stateless protocol works. When computers communicate using a stateless protocol like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), they act like players in a game. Each computer is like a player taking turns sending messages to each other.
			- But just like in our game example, with a stateless protocol, computers don't remember what happened in previous messages. Each message is treated as a separate and independent piece of information. It doesn't matter if there were messages before or what they contained. The computers only focus on what's in the current message.
			- This means that when you request something from a website (like asking for a web page), the website doesn't remember any previous requests you made. It only knows about the specific request you just sent. It doesn't keep track of any past interactions or who you are. It's like starting a new conversation every time you visit a webpage.
			- So, in simple terms, a stateless protocol means that computers communicate as if they have a short-term memory. They don't remember past interactions, and each message they send or receive is treated individually without any connection to what happened before.
		- if HTTP is a stateless protocol then how website owner keep track of user activity on the website?
			- While HTTP itself is stateless, meaning it doesn't remember past interactions, website owners have ways to keep track of user activity on their websites. They use additional techniques to maintain a sense of continuity and track user information. Let me explain:
				- Cookies: Websites often use cookies, which are small files stored on the user's computer. These cookies contain information that helps identify and remember users. When you visit a website, it may send a cookie to your browser, and the browser stores it. This way, when you visit the website again, the browser sends the cookie back, allowing the website to recognize you and remember certain details about your previous visits, such as preferences or login information.
				- Sessions: [[#Sessions]]
				- User Accounts: Websites often offer user account registration. When you create an account and log in, the website stores your account information on their server. This allows the website to associate your activity with your specific account. As long as you remain logged in, the website can track and remember your actions, preferences, and personalized settings.
				- Server-Side Storage: Website owners can store data on their servers to track user activity. They can save information about user interactions, such as pages visited, actions performed, or items purchased. By associating this data with your unique identifier (e.g., session ID or user account), the website owner can analyze and understand user behavior.
			- So, while HTTP itself doesn't retain information between requests, website owners use techniques like cookies, sessions, user accounts, and server-side storage to maintain continuity and track user activity. These methods enable websites to provide personalized experiences, remember preferences, and offer features such as shopping carts, user profiles, and customized content

## Objects and Methods
- An object is a data structure that represents a real-world entity or concept. It encapsulates both data (known as properties or attributes) and behaviors (known as methods or functions) related to that entity. Objects allow us to model and manipulate complex data structures by grouping related data and behaviors together.
- For example, in a car simulation program, you might have an object called "Car" that has properties like "color," "brand," and "speed," and methods like "start," "accelerate," and "brake." Each instance of the "Car" object can have its own unique values for the properties and can perform actions using the methods.
- Methods, on the other hand, are functions associated with an object. They define the actions or behaviors that the object can perform. Methods are typically used to manipulate the object's internal state, access or modify its properties, or interact with other objects in the program.
- Continuing with the car example, the methods of the "Car" object would define how the car starts, accelerates, and brakes. These methods might modify the "speed" property of the car or interact with other objects such as the engine or brakes.
- In summary, objects represent entities or concepts, combining data and behaviors into a single entity. Methods are functions associated with objects that define their behaviors and allow them to perform actions. Objects and methods work together to organize and structure code, enabling the modeling of real-world scenarios in programming
