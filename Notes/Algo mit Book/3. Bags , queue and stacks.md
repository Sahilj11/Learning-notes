## Generics 
Generics in Java are a powerful feature that allows you to write reusable and type-safe code. They were introduced in Java 5 to provide compile-time type checking and enable you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on types as parameters, rather than on specific concrete types. Here are some key notes and concepts about generics in Java:

1. **Type Safety**: Generics enable you to catch type errors at compile time rather than at runtime, making your code more reliable and easier to maintain.

2. **Generic Classes**: You can create generic classes by adding type parameters inside angle brackets ("< >") after the class name. For example:

    ```java
    public class Box<T> {
        private T value;
    
        public void setValue(T value) {
            this.value = value;
        }
    
        public T getValue() {
            return value;
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Type Parameters**: Type parameters, such as `T` in the example above, act as placeholders for the actual types that will be used when creating instances of the generic class.

4. **Type Inference**: In many cases, Java can infer the type parameter based on the assignment. For example:

    ```java
    Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
    ```

    Here, Java infers that `T` should be `String` based on the left-hand side of the assignment.

5. **Generic Methods**: You can also create generic methods within non-generic classes or generic classes. Here's an example:

    ```java
    public <T> T genericMethod(T[] array) {
        if (array.length > 0) {
            return array[0];
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }
    ```

6. **Wildcards**: Wildcards allow you to represent an unknown type within a generic class or method. The wildcard symbol `?` is used, and there are three types of wildcards: `? extends T`, `? super T`, and `?`.

7. **Bounded Type Parameters**: You can restrict the types that can be used as type parameters by using bounded type parameters. For example, `T extends Number` means `T` must be a subtype of `Number`.

8. **Generic Interfaces**: You can define generic interfaces, which work similarly to generic classes but can be implemented by various classes with different type parameters.

9. **Type Erasure**: Java uses type erasure to implement generics. This means that generic type information is mostly removed during compilation and does not exist at runtime. This was done to maintain backward compatibility with pre-Java 5 code.

10. **Common Use Cases**: Generics are commonly used in collections (e.g., `List<T>`), as well as in classes like `Optional<T>` and utility classes that work with various types.

11. **Unchecked and Raw Types**: You can still use raw types (e.g., `List` instead of `List<String>`) and suppress unchecked warnings, but it's generally discouraged as it undermines type safety.

12. **Type Parameter Naming**: While `T` is a commonly used name for type parameters, you can use any valid Java identifier as a type parameter name.

Generics in Java are a fundamental concept that helps you write more flexible and robust code. They are widely used in libraries, frameworks, and everyday Java programming to create reusable and type-safe components.

## Wrapper class and autoboxing and auto-unboxing
Wrapper classes in Java are a set of classes that provide a way to represent primitive data types (like `int`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.) as objects. Each primitive data type in Java has a corresponding wrapper class, and these classes are part of the `java.lang` package. The primary reasons for the existence of wrapper classes in Java are as follows:

1. **Object-Oriented Compatibility**: Java is an object-oriented language, and in object-oriented programming, everything is an object. However, primitive data types are not objects in the traditional sense. To make primitive data types compatible with Java's object-oriented model, wrapper classes were introduced. Wrapper classes allow you to treat primitive types as objects.

2. **Nullable Types**: Primitive data types cannot represent null values. Wrapper classes, on the other hand, can represent null because they are objects. This is especially useful when dealing with data from sources where values might be missing.

3. **Generics**: Generics in Java work only with objects, not with primitive data types. If you need to use a primitive type with generics, you can use its corresponding wrapper class. For example, you can use `Integer` instead of `int` in a generic data structure.

4. **Collection Framework**: Java's Collection framework (e.g., `List`, `Set`, `Map`) can only store objects, not primitive types. Wrapper classes allow you to store primitive values in collections.

5. **Methods for Conversion and Manipulation**: Wrapper classes provide methods for converting between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper objects. For example, `Integer.parseInt(String)` converts a `String` to an `int`, and `Integer.toString(int)` converts an `int` to a `String`. These classes also provide methods for common operations on primitive values.

Here are some common wrapper classes and their corresponding primitive data types:

- `Integer`: Corresponds to `int`
- `Double`: Corresponds to `double`
- `Boolean`: Corresponds to `boolean`
- `Character`: Corresponds to `char`
- `Byte`: Corresponds to `byte`
- `Short`: Corresponds to `short`
- `Long`: Corresponds to `long`
- `Float`: Corresponds to `float`

Example of using wrapper classes:

```java
// Using Integer wrapper class
Integer x = 10; // Autoboxing (converting int to Integer)
int y = x;      // Unboxing (converting Integer to int)

// Using Boolean wrapper class
Boolean isJavaFun = true;

// Using Character wrapper class
Character grade = 'A';

// Using Double wrapper class
Double pi = 3.14159265359;
```

In summary, wrapper classes in Java are needed to bridge the gap between primitive data types and objects, allowing you to work with primitive types in an object-oriented way, handle null values, and use them effectively in generic and collection-based operations.
```java
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
stack.push(17);
// auto-boxing (int -> Integer)
int i = stack.pop(); // auto-unboxing (Integer -> int)
```
Automatically casting a primitive type to a wrapper type is known as autoboxing, and
automatically casting a wrapper type to a primitive type is known as auto-unboxing.
In this example, Java automatically casts (autoboxes) the primitive value 17 to be of
type Integer when we pass it to the push() method. The pop() method returns an
Integer, which Java casts (auto-unboxes) to an int before assigning it to the variable i.

## Bags
A bag is a collection where removing items is not supported—its purpose is to
provide clients with the ability to collect items and then to iterate through the collected
items (the client can also test if a bag is empty and find its number of items). The order
of iteration is unspecified and should be immaterial to the client

## Queue 
to preserve there relative order 

## Stack 
- follow principle of LIFO

## Implementation of collection 
### Array resizing 
- representing stack as array 
- but as we know that array cannot be resized after declaration then with every push() call we have to check if the length is available and if not then declare array 2 twice the size and move all those element to new array . similarly with pop()  we can check if array is not too much empty then we can declare a small array and move element there.
- the appropriate test
is whether the stack size is less than one-fourth the array size. After the array is halved,
it will be about half full and can accommodate a substantial number of push() and
pop() operations before having to change the size of the array again.

### Loitering
Java’s garbage collection policy is to reclaim the memory associated with
any objects that can no longer be accessed. In our pop() implementations, the refer-
ence to the popped item remains in the array. The item is effectively an orphan—it will
be never be accessed again—but the Java garbage collector has no way to know this
until it is overwritten. Even when the client is done with the item, the reference in the
array may keep it alive. This condition (holding a reference to an item that is no longer
needed) is known as loitering.

In this case, loitering is easy to avoid, by setting the array
entry corresponding to the popped item to null, thus overwriting the unused refer-
ence and making it possible for the system to reclaim the memory associated with the
popped item when the client is finished with it.

### Linked list 
A linked list is a recursive data structure that is either empty (null) or a
reference to a node having a generic item and a reference to a linked list.
The node in this definition is an abstract entity that might hold any kind of data, in ad-
dition to the node reference that characterizes its role in building linked lists

- we can also achieve this task using array but in linked list it is easier to insert item
#### Inserting at beginning 
to insert the string not at the beginning of a given linked list whose first node is first, we save first in oldfirst, assign to first a new Node, and assign its item field to not and its
next field to oldfirst. This code for inserting a node at the beginning of a linked list
involves just a few assignment statements, so the amount of time that it takes is inde-
pendent of the length of the list
