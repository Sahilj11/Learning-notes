A polyfill, also spelled "polyfill," is a piece of code (usually JavaScript) that provides modern functionality on older browsers or environments that do not natively support certain features, methods, or APIs. It allows developers to use newer JavaScript features or APIs while maintaining compatibility with older browsers that lack support for those features.

The term "polyfill" is a combination of "poly," which means "many" or "multiple," and "fill," which means "to make full or complete." A polyfill fills the gaps in browser support by implementing missing features using standard web technologies. Polyfills are particularly useful when developing web applications that need to support a wide range of browsers, including older versions.

Polyfills can be written by developers or obtained from various libraries and sources. They are usually loaded alongside the application code and run before the main code executes. When a browser has native support for a feature, the polyfill typically detects that and avoids interfering with the native implementation.

For example, if a browser does not support the `Array.prototype.includes` method (introduced in ECMAScript 2016), you can use a polyfill to add support for it:

```javascript
// Polyfill for Array.prototype.includes
if (!Array.prototype.includes) {
  Array.prototype.includes = function (searchElement, fromIndex) {
    // ... implementation code to add the missing method ...
  };
}
```

With this polyfill, you can safely use the `Array.prototype.includes` method in your code, even if the browser being used lacks native support for it.

It's worth noting that with the advancement of web standards and browsers, the need for polyfills has decreased over time. However, they are still essential in some cases, especially for supporting older browsers or specific edge cases where certain features are missing. As browsers update and become more compliant with web standards, the use of polyfills may become less necessary, and developers can gradually remove them from their codebases.
