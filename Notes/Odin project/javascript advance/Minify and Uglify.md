In JavaScript, "minify" and "uglify" are both techniques used to optimize and reduce the size of JavaScript code for better performance on the web. 

1. **Minification**: Minification refers to the process of removing unnecessary characters from the source code without altering its functionality. This includes removing whitespace, comments, and reducing the length of variable and function names. Minification helps reduce the file size, leading to faster downloads and improved performance. However, it doesn't change the logic or behavior of the code.

2. **Uglification**: Uglification, also known as obfuscation, takes the process of minification a step further by transforming the code to make it more difficult to understand and reverse-engineer. It renames variables and functions to shorter, cryptic names that are harder to decipher. Uglification also applies various code transformations, such as rewriting control flow and replacing literals with shorter representations. The goal is to make the code challenging to read and comprehend, making it less desirable for someone to try to copy or modify the code.

Both minification and uglification are typically performed as part of a build process or deployment pipeline to optimize JavaScript code before it is deployed to production. There are various tools and libraries available, such as UglifyJS, Terser, and Babel, that can handle the minification and uglification processes. These tools automate the process and generate minified or uglified versions of the original JavaScript files, which can then be used in production environments.
