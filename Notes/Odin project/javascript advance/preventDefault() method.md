In JavaScript, when you interact with web pages or applications, events can occur. These events can be things like clicking a button, submitting a form, or pressing a key on the keyboard. When an event happens, it often has a default action associated with it. For example, clicking a link will usually take you to another page.

The `preventDefault()` method is a function that can be called on an event object to stop the default action from happening. It allows you to prevent the browser or application from performing its default behavior associated with the event.

By calling `preventDefault()` on an event, you can control what happens when an event occurs. You can decide to override the default behavior and define your own actions instead.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `preventDefault()`:

```javascript
const link = document.querySelector("#myLink");

link.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  event.preventDefault(); // Prevents the link from navigating to a new page
  console.log("Link clicked, but default action prevented.");
});
```

In the example above, we select an HTML element with the id `myLink` using `document.querySelector()`. We then attach a click event listener to that element. When the link is clicked, the event listener function is called.

Inside the event listener function, we call `event.preventDefault()` to prevent the default action of the link, which is navigating to a new page. Instead of following the link, we log a message to the console.

By using `preventDefault()`, you can customize the behavior of events and control what happens when they occur. It gives you the ability to override default actions and implement your own logic and behavior in response to events.
