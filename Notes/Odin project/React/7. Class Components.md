## Why they are not used today 
If you look into any older React codebase, you’ll notice a lot of classes. These are known as class-based components. Prior to February 2019, functional components were also called state-less, as there was no way to manage state in them. This was changed when hooks were introduced, leading to less verbose and ‘neater’ components.

## How to create 
```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class ClassInput extends Component {
  // Some code goes here
}

/*
  This can also be written as:

  import React from 'react';
  class ClassInput extends React.Component {}
  export default ClassInput;

  instead of destructuring the `Component` during import
*/

export default ClassInput;
```

The props, that get passed into this component, gets passed into the class’s `constructor`. This, along with the `super` method, allows you to use the props in context to `this`, which, in _this_ case, refers to the component

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class ClassInput extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  // Some more code goes here
}

export default ClassInput;
```

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class ClassInput extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  // Some more code goes here

  render() {
    return (
      <section>
        <h3>{this.props.name}</h3>
        {/* The input field to enter To-Do's */}
        <form>
          <label htmlFor="task-entry">Enter a task: </label>
          <input type="text" name="task-entry" />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
        <h4>All the tasks!</h4>
        {/* The list of all the To-Do's, displayed */}
        <ul></ul>
      </section>
    );
  }
}

export default ClassInput;
```


Whenever a method is declared, you must `bind` the `this` of the method to that of the class in order to work with it, as by default, the methods in a class are not bound to it. Usually, you do this inside the constructor and not at runtime in the render method.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class ClassInput extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      todos: [],
      inputVal: "",
    };

    this.handleInputChange = this.handleInputChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleInputChange(e) {
    this.setState((state) => ({
      ...state,
      inputVal: e.target.value,
    }));
  }

  handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    this.setState((state) => ({
      todos: state.todos.concat(state.inputVal),
      inputVal: "",
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <section>
        <h3>{this.props.name}</h3>
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          <label htmlFor="task-entry">Enter a task: </label>
          <input
            type="text"
            name="task-entry"
            value={this.state.inputVal}
            onChange={this.handleInputChange}
          />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
        <h4>All the tasks!</h4>
        <ul>
          {this.state.todos.map((todo) => (
            <li key={todo}>{todo}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </section>
    );
  }
}

export default ClassInput;
```
