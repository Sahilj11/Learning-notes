## What is side-effect
Certain components in React need to interact with things outside themselves. These things can be anything from querying data from a server to finding/changing the position of the component on the webpage or even sending some data to a server when necessary. This interaction with the _outside world_ is called a side-effect.

While we are already familiar with rendering code and adding event handlers, it is not enough for all uses, like when you want to connect to your server and fetch messages to show to a user. Effects let you run some code to synchronize your component as necessary, on rendering or a reactive/state value change rather than on a particular event.

Similar to how we have the `useState` hook, React offers us a handy `useEffect` hook to use effects in our components.

Certainly! `useEffect` is a fundamental hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It's used for handling tasks that involve interactions with the outside world, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, setting up subscriptions, or managing timers. The `useEffect` hook is designed to mimic the lifecycle methods of class components (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`).

Here's a more detailed explanation of `useEffect` and the dependency array:

1. **The `useEffect` Function**:

   `useEffect` is a function that accepts two arguments:

   - The first argument is a function that contains the code you want to run as a side effect. This function is often referred to as the "effect function."

   - The second argument is an optional array of dependencies, which is sometimes called the "dependency array."

2. **The Effect Function**:

   The effect function is the code that you want to execute when certain conditions are met. It can contain any JavaScript code, including asynchronous operations like data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscription setup.

   For example:

   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     // Code for your side effect
   }, []);
   ```

   In this example, the effect function is an empty function, which means it doesn't depend on any variables or props. It will run after the component's initial render.

3. **The Dependency Array**:

   The dependency array is an optional argument that specifies the dependencies of the effect function. It determines when the effect should run.

   - If the dependency array is empty (`[]`), the effect runs after the initial render and doesn't depend on any specific variables or props. It's equivalent to `componentDidMount` in class components.

   - If the dependency array is not provided (omitted), the effect runs after every render, including the initial render. It's equivalent to `componentDidUpdate` in class components.

   - If the dependency array contains variables or props, the effect will run whenever any of those dependencies change between renders. This allows you to create effects that respond to changes in specific data.

   For example:

   ```jsx
   const someVariable = 42;

   useEffect(() => {
     // Code that depends on someVariable
   }, [someVariable]);
   ```

   In this example, the effect will run whenever the `someVariable` value changes.

4. **Cleanup Function**:

   The effect function can also return a cleanup function if necessary. This cleanup function is executed when the component unmounts or when the dependencies change and the effect needs to be cleaned up before the new effect runs. It's useful for tasks like unsubscribing from event listeners or canceling network requests to prevent memory leaks.

   For example:

   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     // Code for your side effect

     return () => {
       // Cleanup code
     };
   }, [/* dependencies */]);
   ```

To summarize, `useEffect` is a versatile hook in React for managing side effects in functional components. The dependency array allows you to control when the effect runs based on changes in specific variables or props, and the cleanup function ensures that resources are properly released when the component unmounts or when the dependencies change.


#### Clean up function in detail
In React, the `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects can include things like data fetching, setting up subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. The `cleanup function` in `useEffect` is a way to clean up or undo any of these side effects when the component is about to unmount or when a new effect is being applied.

Think of it like this: Imagine you're setting up a bunch of things in your component, like listening for a click event or fetching data from a server. When you're done with your component or when you want to set up new things, you want to make sure you clean up or undo the previous stuff you set up. That's where the cleanup function comes in.

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This function runs when the component mounts
    // It sets up a subscription or fetches some data
    const subscription = subscribeToData((result) => {
      setData(result);
    });

    // This is the cleanup function
    // It undoes or cleans up what we did above
    return () => {
      subscription.unsubscribe(); // Unsubscribe from data updates
    };
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs only once

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? (
        <p>Data: {data}</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading data...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, when the component mounts, it sets up a subscription to some data source. The cleanup function is used to unsubscribe from that data source when the component unmounts or when a new effect is applied (if you change the dependencies in the dependency array).

So, in easy language, the cleanup function in `useEffect` helps you tidy up or stop any ongoing tasks or effects when you're done with them to prevent memory leaks and unexpected behavior in your React components.

**What is unmounting**

Unmounting a component in React means that the component is being removed or "unmounted" from the DOM (Document Object Model). When a component is unmounted, it is no longer part of the visible user interface, and its associated JavaScript code is cleaned up to free up resources.

In the example I provided with the countdown timer:

```javascript
return () => {
  clearInterval(timerInterval); // Stop the timer when the component unmounts or a new countdown starts
};
```

The cleanup function I mentioned is specifically designed to handle the unmounting of the component. When the component is unmounted, perhaps because the user navigates away from the page or switches to a different part of the application, React will automatically call this cleanup function. The purpose of this cleanup function is to stop the timer (in this case) and perform any necessary cleanup tasks to ensure that the component's code doesn't continue to run or use resources after it's been removed from the screen. This helps prevent memory leaks and unexpected behavior in your application.

So, "unmounting" is the process of removing a component from the DOM and cleaning up any resources associated with it, and React provides a mechanism to perform cleanup actions when this happens using the cleanup function in `useEffect`.
