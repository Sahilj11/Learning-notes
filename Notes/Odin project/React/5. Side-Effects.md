## What is side-effect
Certain components in React need to interact with things outside themselves. These things can be anything from querying data from a server to finding/changing the position of the component on the webpage or even sending some data to a server when necessary. This interaction with the _outside world_ is called a side-effect.

While we are already familiar with rendering code and adding event handlers, it is not enough for all uses, like when you want to connect to your server and fetch messages to show to a user. Effects let you run some code to synchronize your component as necessary, on rendering or a reactive/state value change rather than on a particular event.

Similar to how we have the `useState` hook, React offers us a handy `useEffect` hook to use effects in our components.

Certainly! `useEffect` is a fundamental hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It's used for handling tasks that involve interactions with the outside world, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, setting up subscriptions, or managing timers. The `useEffect` hook is designed to mimic the lifecycle methods of class components (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`).

Here's a more detailed explanation of `useEffect` and the dependency array:

1. **The `useEffect` Function**:

   `useEffect` is a function that accepts two arguments:

   - The first argument is a function that contains the code you want to run as a side effect. This function is often referred to as the "effect function."

   - The second argument is an optional array of dependencies, which is sometimes called the "dependency array."

2. **The Effect Function**:

   The effect function is the code that you want to execute when certain conditions are met. It can contain any JavaScript code, including asynchronous operations like data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscription setup.

   For example:

   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     // Code for your side effect
   }, []);
   ```

   In this example, the effect function is an empty function, which means it doesn't depend on any variables or props. It will run after the component's initial render.

3. **The Dependency Array**:

   The dependency array is an optional argument that specifies the dependencies of the effect function. It determines when the effect should run.

   - If the dependency array is empty (`[]`), the effect runs after the initial render and doesn't depend on any specific variables or props. It's equivalent to `componentDidMount` in class components.

   - If the dependency array is not provided (omitted), the effect runs after every render, including the initial render. It's equivalent to `componentDidUpdate` in class components.

   - If the dependency array contains variables or props, the effect will run whenever any of those dependencies change between renders. This allows you to create effects that respond to changes in specific data.

   For example:

   ```jsx
   const someVariable = 42;

   useEffect(() => {
     // Code that depends on someVariable
   }, [someVariable]);
   ```

   In this example, the effect will run whenever the `someVariable` value changes.

4. **Cleanup Function**:

   The effect function can also return a cleanup function if necessary. This cleanup function is executed when the component unmounts or when the dependencies change and the effect needs to be cleaned up before the new effect runs. It's useful for tasks like unsubscribing from event listeners or canceling network requests to prevent memory leaks.

   For example:

   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     // Code for your side effect

     return () => {
       // Cleanup code
     };
   }, [/* dependencies */]);
   ```

To summarize, `useEffect` is a versatile hook in React for managing side effects in functional components. The dependency array allows you to control when the effect runs based on changes in specific variables or props, and the cleanup function ensures that resources are properly released when the component unmounts or when the dependencies change.


#### Clean up function in detail
In React, the `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects can include things like data fetching, setting up subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. The `cleanup function` in `useEffect` is a way to clean up or undo any of these side effects when the component is about to unmount or when a new effect is being applied.

Think of it like this: Imagine you're setting up a bunch of things in your component, like listening for a click event or fetching data from a server. When you're done with your component or when you want to set up new things, you want to make sure you clean up or undo the previous stuff you set up. That's where the cleanup function comes in.

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This function runs when the component mounts
    // It sets up a subscription or fetches some data
    const subscription = subscribeToData((result) => {
      setData(result);
    });

    // This is the cleanup function
    // It undoes or cleans up what we did above
    return () => {
      subscription.unsubscribe(); // Unsubscribe from data updates
    };
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs only once

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? (
        <p>Data: {data}</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading data...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, when the component mounts, it sets up a subscription to some data source. The cleanup function is used to unsubscribe from that data source when the component unmounts or when a new effect is applied (if you change the dependencies in the dependency array).

So, in easy language, the cleanup function in `useEffect` helps you tidy up or stop any ongoing tasks or effects when you're done with them to prevent memory leaks and unexpected behavior in your React components.

**What is unmounting**

Unmounting a component in React means that the component is being removed or "unmounted" from the DOM (Document Object Model). When a component is unmounted, it is no longer part of the visible user interface, and its associated JavaScript code is cleaned up to free up resources.

In the example I provided with the countdown timer:

```javascript
return () => {
  clearInterval(timerInterval); // Stop the timer when the component unmounts or a new countdown starts
};
```

The cleanup function I mentioned is specifically designed to handle the unmounting of the component. When the component is unmounted, perhaps because the user navigates away from the page or switches to a different part of the application, React will automatically call this cleanup function. The purpose of this cleanup function is to stop the timer (in this case) and perform any necessary cleanup tasks to ensure that the component's code doesn't continue to run or use resources after it's been removed from the screen. This helps prevent memory leaks and unexpected behavior in your application.

So, "unmounting" is the process of removing a component from the DOM and cleaning up any resources associated with it, and React provides a mechanism to perform cleanup actions when this happens using the cleanup function in `useEffect`.

### When not to use useEffect
You do not need to use an effect if you are only calculating something based on the state during rendering. For a change in a component, due to a change in the props, you can simply calculate and set it during rendering.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function AdditionDisplay() {
  const [number1, setNumber1] = useState(0);
  const [number2, setNumber2] = useState(0);

  // This is all unnecessary.

  // const [sum, setSum] = useState(0);
  // useEffect(() => {
  //   setSum(number1 + number2);
  // }, [number1, number2]);

  const sum = number1 + number2;

  return (
    <p>{number1} + {number2} = {sum}</p>
  );
}
```

- You do not need effects for events. Code that runs when a component is **displayed** should be in effects, the rest should be in events.
    
    ```jsx
    import React, { useState } from "react";
    
    export default function App() {
      const [input, setInput] = useState("");
    
      const handleInput = (e) => {
        setInput(e.target.value);
      }
    
      // You should avoid direct manipulation when not necessary
    
      // useEffect(() => {
      //   document.getElementById("name").addEventListener("change", handleInput);
      //   return () => {
      //     document.getElementById("name").removeEventListener("change", handleInput);
      //   }
      // });
          
      return (
        <>
          {/* <input id="name" /> */}
    
          <input onChange={handleInput} value={input} />
          <p>{ input }</p>
        </>
      )
    }
    ```
    

- You do not need an effect to reset the state based on a condition most of the time. You have learned about keys in React. Just like using a key on a list’s item, adding one to a component, based on the state on which it should be reset creates a unique version of that component for each change in the value of the state.
    
- If you are having issues with managing your state and want to use an effect to update the state of a parent or some other non-child component, consider **lifting the state**. As we know, in React, the state flows in one direction, generally down the DOM. So the parents know of the data before passing it to the children. If multiple children are required to make use of a single state, it should be moved up to the parent that has all of the components that need it, instead of using escape hatches like an effect.


## React docs on useEffect
The statement you provided highlights the fundamental difference between the lifecycle of components in a React application and the lifecycle of effects created using the `useEffect` hook.

1. **Component Lifecycle:**
   - Components in React have a well-defined lifecycle that consists of three main phases: mounting, updating, and unmounting.
   - **Mounting:** This phase occurs when a component is first created and inserted into the DOM. During this phase, component constructor and render methods are called.
   - **Updating:** This phase occurs when a component's state or props change, and it needs to be re-rendered. React calls methods like `shouldComponentUpdate`, `componentWillUpdate`, and `componentDidUpdate` during this phase.
   - **Unmounting:** This phase occurs when a component is removed from the DOM. React calls the `componentWillUnmount` method to allow the component to perform cleanup tasks.

2. **Effect Lifecycle:**
   - Effects, created using the `useEffect` hook, have a simpler lifecycle in comparison.
   - An effect can only do two primary things:
     - **Start Synchronizing:** When you define an effect using `useEffect`, you can specify a function that will run after the component renders. This function is used to start synchronizing something with the component, such as fetching data from an API, setting up subscriptions, or updating the DOM.
     - **Stop Synchronizing:** To prevent memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup, you can return a cleanup function from the effect. This cleanup function is called when the component is about to unmount, or when a new effect is triggered. It is used to stop or undo whatever synchronization was started in the effect. For example, you can unsubscribe from a data source or clear intervals or timeouts.

In summary, while components have a more complex lifecycle that includes multiple phases such as mounting, updating, and unmounting, effects have a simpler purpose. Effects are primarily used to start and stop synchronizing external actions or side effects with the component. They allow you to manage side effects in a declarative and consistent way within functional components. This separation of concerns between component lifecycles and effect lifecycles helps improve code organization, maintainability, and predictability in React applications.

### Code example of useEffect
To illustrate this point, consider this Effect connecting your component to a chat server:

```jsx
const serverUrl = 'https://localhost:1234';function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  useEffect(() => {    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);    connection.connect();    return () => {      connection.disconnect();    };  }, [roomId]);  // ...}
```

Your Effect’s body specifies how to **start synchronizing:**

```jsx
         const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);    connection.connect();    return () => {      connection.disconnect();    };   
```

The cleanup function returned by your Effect specifies how to **stop synchronizing:**

```jsx
const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);    connection.connect();    return () => {      connection.disconnect();    }; 
```

Intuitively, you might think that React would **start synchronizing** when your component mounts and **stop synchronizing** when your component unmounts. However, this is not the end of the story! Sometimes, it may also be necessary to **start and stop synchronizing multiple times** while the component remains mounted.


Previously, you were thinking from the component’s perspective. When you looked from the component’s perspective, it was tempting to think of Effects as “callbacks” or “lifecycle events” that fire at a specific time like “after a render” or “before unmount”. This way of thinking gets complicated very fast, so it’s best to avoid.

**Instead, always focus on a single start/stop cycle at a time. It shouldn’t matter whether a component is mounting, updating, or unmounting. All you need to do is to describe how to start synchronization and how to stop it. If you do it well, your Effect will be resilient to being started and stopped as many times as it’s needed.**

This might remind you how you don’t think whether a component is mounting or updating when you write the rendering logic that creates JSX. You describe what should be on the screen, and React figures out the rest.

**React verifies that your Effect can re-synchronize by forcing it to do that immediately in development.** This might remind you of opening a door and closing it an extra time to check if the door lock works. React starts and stops your Effect one extra time in development to check you’ve implemented its cleanup well.

Every time after your component re-renders, React will look at the array of dependencies that you have passed. If any of the values in the array is different from the value at the same spot that you passed during the previous render, React will re-synchronize (refers to the process of updating the effect when certain dependencies have changed.)your Effect.
On the other hand, if your component re-renders but `roomId` has not changed, your Effect will remain connected to the same room.

## Each effect represent a separate synchronisation process so try writing useEffect separately for different process

## All variables declared in the component body are reactive.
Props and state aren’t the only reactive values. Values that you calculate from them are also reactive. If the props or state change, your component will re-render, and the values calculated from them will also change. This is why all variables from the component body used by the Effect should be in the Effect dependency list.

## Infinite loop of React.useEffect()
#### 1 The infinite loop and side-effect updating state
```jsx   
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';        
function CountInputChanges() {    
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');    
  const [count, setCount] = useState(-1);        
  useEffect(() => setCount(count + 1));        
  const onChange = ({ target }) => setValue(target.value);        
  return (     
      <div>    
      <input type="text" value={value} onChange={onChange} />    
      <div>Number of changes: {count}</div>    </div>    
    )    
}    
```
Because `useEffect(() => setCount(count + 1))` is used without the dependencies argument, `() => setCount(count + 1)` callback is executed after every rendering of the component
`count` state variable increases uncontrollably, even if you haven't typed anything into the input. That's an infinite loop.

After initial rendering, `useEffect()` executes the side-effect callback and updates the state. The state update triggers re-rendering. After re-rendering `useEffect()` executes the side-effect callback and again updates the state, which triggers again a re-rendering. ...and so on indefinitely.

![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020231009074816.png )

##### 1.1 Fixing dependencies
- By adding `[value]` as a dependency of `useEffect(..., [value])`, the `count` state variable will only be updated when `[value]` changes. This solves the infinite loop.
- ![](../../statics/Pasted%20image%2020231009074942.png )

#### 2. Infinite loop and new object references 

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
function CountSecrets() {    
  const [secret, setSecret] = useState({ value: "", countSecrets: 0 });            useEffect(() => {    
      if (secret.value === 'secret') {    
         setSecret(s => ({...s, countSecrets: s.countSecrets + 1}));    
         }    
    }, [secret]);        
  const onChange = ({ target }) => {    
    setSecret(s => ({ ...s, value: target.value }));    
   };        
 return (    
     <div>    
    <input type="text" value={secret.value} onChange={onChange} />         <div>Number of secrets: {secret.countSecrets}</div>    </div>    
    );    
} 
```

The `secret` object is used as a dependency of `useEffect(..., [secret])`. Inside the side-effect callback, as soon as the input value equals `'secret'`, the state updater function is called:
`   setSecret(s => ({...s, countSecrets: s.countSecrets + 1}));            `

which increments the secrets counter `countSecrets`, but also creates _a new object_.

`secret` now is a new object and the dependency has changed. So `useEffect(..., [secret])` invokes again the side-effect that updates the state and a new `secret` object is created again, and so on.

2 objects in JavaScript are equal only if they reference exactly the same object.

this code also has infinite loop problem

##### 2.1 Avoid object as dependencies
Because of the objects creation and referential equality problem, it's wise to avoid objects as deps in `useEffect()`. Stick to primitives when possible:


```jsx   
let count = 0;        
useEffect(() => {    // some logic    }, [count]); // Good!              
```

```js
let myObject = {    prop: 'Value'    };        
useEffect(() => {    // some logic    }, [myObject]);  Not good!        useEffect(() => {    // some logic    }, [myObject.prop]); Good!
```
