React class components have several lifecycle methods that allow you to execute code at particular points in the component's lifecycle. With the introduction of React Hooks in functional components, some of these lifecycle methods have been replaced by equivalent hooks. Here's an explanation of each lifecycle method:

1. **Mounting:**
   - **`constructor(props)`**: This is the first method called when an instance of a component is being created. It is used for initializing state and binding event handlers.
   - **`render()`**: This is a required method that examines this.props and this.state and returns JSX or `null` or `false`. It is a pure function and should not modify the state directly.
   - **`componentDidMount()`**: This method is called after the component is rendered for the first time. It is often used to trigger network requests or initialize subscriptions.

2. **Updating:**
   - **`render()`**: The render method is called again to reflect the changes in state and props.
   - **`componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`**: This method is called after the component has been updated in the DOM. It's often used for interactions with the DOM or to perform network requests based on prop/state changes.

3. **Unmounting:**
   - **`componentWillUnmount()`**: This method is called before the component is removed from the DOM. It's used to perform cleanup, such as canceling network requests, clearing up subscriptions, or cleaning up timers.

It's important to note that with the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, functional components can now also use lifecycle-like methods with hooks such as `useEffect` to achieve similar behavior.

### Introduction of useEffect 

Now that we’ve learnt about class lifecycle methods, it’s useful to understand that the `useEffect` hook used in functional components is essentially a combination of `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. Which method/methods it relates to varies based on it’s dependency array, and if it returns anything.

- An empty dependency array would be equivalent to `componentDidMount`.
- A dependency array with a value/values in it would be a combination of `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`, but only updating when dependencies change.
- No dependency array would be equivalent to `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` combined.
- A return function inside of a `useEffect()` hook would be equivalent to `componentWillUnmount`.

```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    placeholderFunction();
    return () => cleanupFunction();
  }, [])
```
