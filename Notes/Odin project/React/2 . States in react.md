### Intro 
- In simple words state is a component memory 
- The `useState` hook is a built-in hook in React that allows you to define state in a functional component. It takes an initial value as a parameter and returns an array with two elements that we can destructure to get.
	1. The current state value
	2. A function to update the state value
State definition with `useState` commonly follows this pattern:

```js
const [stateValue, setStateValue] = useState(initialValue);

// adapted for our use case:
const [backgroundColor, setBackgroundColor] = useState(initialColor);
```

### What is going on under the hood 
In React, when a component’s state or props change, the component is destroyed and recreated from scratch.
This includes the variables, functions, and React nodes. The entire component is recreated but this time the latest state value will be returned from `useState`. This process is called rerendering.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
const COLORS = ["pink", "green", "blue", "yellow", "purple"];

function App() {
  const [backgroundColor, setBackgroundColor] = useState(COLORS[0]);

  const onButtonClick = (color) => () => {
    setBackgroundColor(color);
  };

  return (
    <div
      className="App"
      style={{
        backgroundColor,
      }}
    >
      {COLORS.map((color) => (
        <button
          type="button"
          key={color}
          onClick={onButtonClick(color)}
          className={backgroundColor === color ? "selected" : ""}
        >
          {color}
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```
using this example 
Whenever `setBackgroundColor` is called, our `App` component is rerendered. Essentially, the component is recreated which means the `onButtonClick` function and our `div` and `button`’s are recreated as well. You might wonder, shouldn’t the `backgroundColor` state be recreated as well? Well, React takes the responsibility of keeping track of the latest state and providing it to the component. The initial state value is only used for the component’s first render and is ignored on subsequent renders.
