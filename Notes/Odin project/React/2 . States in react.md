### Intro 
- In simple words state is a component memory 
- The `useState` hook is a built-in hook in React that allows you to define state in a functional component. It takes an initial value as a parameter and returns an array with two elements that we can destructure to get.
	1. The current state value
	2. A function to update the state value
State definition with `useState` commonly follows this pattern:

```js
const [stateValue, setStateValue] = useState(initialValue);

// adapted for our use case:
const [backgroundColor, setBackgroundColor] = useState(initialColor);
```

### What is going on under the hood 
In React, when a component’s state or props change, the component is destroyed and recreated from scratch.
This includes the variables, functions, and React nodes. The entire component is recreated but this time the latest state value will be returned from `useState`. This process is called rerendering.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
const COLORS = ["pink", "green", "blue", "yellow", "purple"];

function App() {
  const [backgroundColor, setBackgroundColor] = useState(COLORS[0]);

  const onButtonClick = (color) => () => {
    setBackgroundColor(color);
  };

  return (
    <div
      className="App"
      style={{
        backgroundColor,
      }}
    >
      {COLORS.map((color) => (
        <button
          type="button"
          key={color}
          onClick={onButtonClick(color)}
          className={backgroundColor === color ? "selected" : ""}
        >
          {color}
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```
using this example 
Whenever `setBackgroundColor` is called, our `App` component is rerendered. Essentially, the component is recreated which means the `onButtonClick` function and our `div` and `button`’s are recreated as well. You might wonder, shouldn’t the `backgroundColor` state be recreated as well? Well, React takes the responsibility of keeping track of the latest state and providing it to the component. The initial state value is only used for the component’s first render and is ignored on subsequent renders.

### Hooks 
Hooks are functions that let you use React features. All hooks are recognizable by the `use` prefix. For example, `useState` is a hook. We’ll use more of these as we get further into the course. For now, remember that hooks have rules that we need to abide by:

1. Hooks can only be called from the top level of a functional component.
2. Hooks can’t be called from inside loops or conditions.

### More of state 

#### What is the issue with this 
```jsx
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  let index = 0;

  function handleClick() {
    index = index + 1;
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
      <p>
        {sculpture.description}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```
The `handleClick` event handler is updating a local variable, `index`. But two things prevent that change from being visible:
1. **Local variables don’t persist between renders.** When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch—it doesn’t consider any changes to the local variables.
2. **Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders.** React doesn’t realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.

To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:
1. **Retain** the data between renders.
2. **Trigger** React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).

The `useState` Hook provides those two things:
1. A **state variable** to retain the data between renders.
2. A **state setter function** to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.

#### Using useState
- Importing 
`import { useState } from 'react'`
- destructing 
`const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);`
here index is a variable and setIndex is a function 

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
      <p>
        {sculpture.description}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```
Code using useState
### Giving component a multiple state variable 
We can have as many state variable as we like in a component 
example of 2 state variable 
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details
      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
    </>
  );
}

```

### State is private and isolated
**if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state!** Changing one of them will not affect the other.

```jsx
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="Page">
      <Gallery />
      <Gallery />
    </div>
  );
}
```
This is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it’s “local” to the specific place on the screen

Unlike props, **state is fully private to the component declaring it.** The parent component can’t change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.

## How to structure state

#### State should not be mutated
 Primitives are already immutable, but if you are using reference type values i.e. arrays and objects, never mutate them.
 ```jsx
// BAD - Don't do this!
   const handleIncreaseAge = () =>{
      // mutating the current state object
      person.age = person.age + 1;
      setPerson(person);
   }

   // GOOD - Do this!
   const handleIncreaseAge = () =>{
      // copy the existing person object into a new object 
      // while updating the age property
      const newPerson = { ...person, age: person.age + 1 };
      setPerson(newPerson);
   }
```

In the above example, notice how we _create_ a new object, and then copy the existing state values into the new object while providing a new value for `age`. That is because if we don’t provide a new object to `setState` it is not guaranteed to re-render the page. Therefore we should always provide a new Object for `setState` to trigger a re-render. `setState` uses Object.is to determine if the previous state is the same.As for nested objects and arrays, state can get tricky fast since you will have to copy the nested items as well. Be careful when using them.

#### More info why immutability is important 
Note how in `handleClick`, you call `.slice()` to create a copy of the `squares` array instead of modifying the existing array. To explain why, we need to discuss immutability and why immutability is important to learn.

There are generally two approaches to changing data. The first approach is to _mutate_ the data by directly changing the data’s values. The second approach is to replace the data with a new copy which has the desired changes. Here is what it would look like if you mutated the `squares` array:

```jsx
const squares = [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];
squares[0] = 'X';// Now `squares` is ["X", null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];
```

And here is what it would look like if you changed data without mutating the `squares` array:

```jsx
const squares = [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];
const nextSquares = ['X', null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null];// Now `squares` is unchanged, but `nextSquares` first element is 'X' rather than `null`
```

The result is the same but by not mutating (changing the underlying data) directly, you gain several benefits.

Immutability makes complex features much easier to implement. Later in this tutorial, you will implement a “time travel” feature that lets you review the game’s history and “jump back” to past moves. This functionality isn’t specific to games—an ability to undo and redo certain actions is a common requirement for apps. Avoiding direct data mutation lets you keep previous versions of the data intact, and reuse them later.

There is also another benefit of immutability. By default, all child components re-render automatically when the state of a parent component changes. This includes even the child components that weren’t affected by the change. Although re-rendering is not by itself noticeable to the user (you shouldn’t actively try to avoid it!), you might want to skip re-rendering a part of the tree that clearly wasn’t affected by it for performance reasons. Immutability makes it very cheap for components to compare whether their data has changed or not.
#### How state update
State updates are asynchronous. What this implies is whenever you call the `setState` function, React will apply the update in the **next** component render. This concept takes a while to wrap your head around. With a lot of practice, you’ll get the hang of it in no time.

Remember, state variables aren’t reactive, the component is. This can be understood by the fact that calling `setState` re-renders the entire component instead of just changing the state variable on the fly


```jsx
function Person() {
   const [person, setPerson] = useState({ name: 'John', age: 100 });

   const handleIncreaseAge = () =>{
      console.log("in handleIncreaseAge (before setPerson call): ", person)
      setPerson({ ...person, age: person.age + 1 });
      // we've called setPerson, surely person has updated?
      console.log("in handleIncreaseAge (after setPerson call): ", person);
   }

   // this console.log runs every time the component renders 
   // what do you think this will print?
   console.log("during render: ", person);
   
   return (
      <>
         <h1>{person.name}</h1>
         <h2>{person.age}</h2>
         <button onClick={handleIncreaseAge}>Increase age</button>
      </>
   )
} 
```
![[Pasted image 20231003072000.png]]
1. The component renders for the first time. The `person` state variable is initialized to `{ name: 'John', age: 100 }`. The “during render” `console.log` prints the state variable.
2. The button is clicked invoking `handleIncreaseAge`. Interestingly, the `console.log` before and after the `setPerson` call prints the same value.
3. The component re-renders. The `person` state variable is updated to `{ name: 'John', age: 101 }`.

The `person` state stays the same throughout the current render of the component. This is what “state as a snapshot” refers to. The `setState` call triggers a component re-render and the `person` state is updated to the new value.

#### State updater function 
```jsx
const handleIncreaseAge = () => {
   setPerson({ ...person, age: person.age + 1 });
   setPerson({ ...person, age: person.age + 1 });
}
```
what is happening here ? When you pass in the value to the `setState` function, React will replace the current state with the value you passed in.

```jsx
const handleIncreaseAge = () => {
   setPerson((prevPerson) => ({ ...prevPerson, age: prevPerson.age + 1 }));
   setPerson((prevPerson) => ({ ...prevPerson, age: prevPerson.age + 1 }));
}
```
When a callback is passed to the `setState` function, it ensures that the latest state is passed in as an argument to the callback.

Using an updater is not always necessary. If you want to change the state using your previous state, and you prefer consistency over verbosity then you might consider using an updater.

#### Controlled components 
There are native HTML elements that maintain their own internal state. The `input` element is a great example. You type into an `input` and it updates its own value on every keystroke. For many use-cases, you would like to _control_ the value of the `input` element i.e. set its value yourself. This is where controlled components come in.
```jsx
function CustomInput() {
   const [value, setValue] = useState('');
   
   return (
      <input
         type="text"
         value={value}
         onChange={(event) => setValue(event.target.value)}
      />
   );
}
```
Instead of letting the `input` maintain its own state, we define our own state using the `useState` hook. We then set the `value` prop of the `input` to the state variable and update the state variable on every `onChange` event. Now, every time the user types something in the input, React will ensure you have the latest comment/review/post (whatever the user was typing) in `value`.

## State as a snapshot
Setting it does not change the state variable you already have, but instead triggers a re-render

## Choosing state structure

### Some principles
#### 1. **Group related state.** If you always update two or more state variables at the same time, consider merging them into a single state variable.
You might sometimes be unsure between using a single or multiple state variables.

Should you do this?

```jsx
const [x, setX] = useState(0);
const [y, setY] = useState(0);
```

Or this?

```jsx
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
```
Technically, you can use either of these approaches. But **if some two state variables always change together, it might be a good idea to unify them into a single state variable.** Then you won’t forget to always keep them in sync
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function MovingDot() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0
  });
  return (
    <div
      onPointerMove={e => {
        setPosition({
          x: e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY
        });
      }}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}>
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'red',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
        left: -10,
        top: -10,
        width: 20,
        height: 20,
     }} />
    </div>
  )
}
```
Another case where you’ll group data into an object or an array is when you don’t know how many pieces of state you’ll need. For example, it’s helpful when you have a form where the user can add custom fields.

*If your state variable is an object, remember that you can’t update only one field in it without explicitly copying the other fields. For example, you can’t do `setPosition({ x: 100 })` in the above example because it would not have the `y` property at all! Instead, if you wanted to set `x` alone, you would either do `setPosition({ ...position, x: 100 })`, or split them into two state variables and do `setX(100)`.*
#### 2. **Avoid contradictions in state.** When the state is structured in a way that several pieces of state may contradict and “disagree” with each other, you leave room for mistakes. Try to avoid this.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function FeedbackForm() {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const [isSending, setIsSending] = useState(false);
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);

  async function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setIsSending(true);
    await sendMessage(text);
    setIsSending(false);
    setIsSent(true);
  }

  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Thanks for feedback!</h1>
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <p>How was your stay at The Prancing Pony?</p>
      <textarea
        disabled={isSending}
        value={text}
        onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}
      />
      <br />
      <button
        disabled={isSending}
        type="submit"
      >
        Send
      </button>
      {isSending && <p>Sending...</p>}
    </form>
  );
}

// Pretend to send a message.
function sendMessage(text) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(resolve, 2000);
  });
}

```
While this code works, it leaves the door open for “impossible” states. For example, if you forget to call `setIsSent` and `setIsSending` together, you may end up in a situation where both `isSending` and `isSent` are `true` at the same time. The more complex your component is, the harder it is to understand what happened.

**Since `isSending` and `isSent` should never be `true` at the same time, it is better to replace them with one `status` state variable that may take one of _three_ valid states:** `'typing'` (initial), `'sending'`, and `'sent'`:

#### 3. **Avoid redundant state.** If you can calculate some information from the component’s props or its existing state variables during rendering, you should not put that information into that component’s state.

If you can calculate some information from the component’s props or its existing state variables during rendering, you **should not** put that information into that component’s state

Avoid this 
```jsx
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');
```

prefer this 
```jsx
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');

  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
```
#### 4. **Avoid duplication in state.** When the same data is duplicated between multiple state variables, or within nested objects, it is difficult to keep them in sync. Reduce duplication when you can.
#### 5. **Avoid deeply nested state.** Deeply hierarchical state is not very convenient to update. When possible, prefer to structure state in a flat way.

## Sharing state b/w components 
Sometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them via props. This is known as _lifting state up,_ and it’s one of the most common things you will do writing React code.


```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Panel({ title, children }) {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}>
          Show
        </button>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}

export default function Accordion() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel title="About">
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel title="Etymology">
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}

```

![[Pasted image 20231005093240.png]]


Notice how pressing one panel’s button does not affect the other panel—they are independent.

To coordinate these two panels, you need to “lift their state up” to a parent component in three steps:

1. **Remove** state from the child components.
2. **Pass** hardcoded data from the common parent.
3. **Add** state to the common parent and pass it down together with the event handlers.

In React, "lifting state up" refers to a technique where you manage the state of a component higher up in the component tree and pass that state down to child components as props. This is often done to share state between multiple components or to make the state accessible to components that are not directly related in terms of their component hierarchy.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to lift state up in React:

1. Identify the State: Determine which component(s) need access to the shared state. This is typically useful when multiple components need to read or update the same piece of data.

2. Create a Parent Component: Create a parent or container component that will manage and hold the shared state. This component should define the state using the `useState` hook or a class component's `this.state` if you're using class components.

3. Pass State as Props: Pass the state and any required functions to child components as props. Child components receive the state as props and use it as needed.

4. Update State in Parent: If any child components need to modify the state, define functions or callbacks in the parent component that allow child components to update the state. Pass these functions down as props as well.

Here's a simple example to illustrate lifting state up in React:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// Parent Component
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter App</h1>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
      <ChildComponent count={count} />
    </div>
  );
}

// Child Component
function ChildComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count from Parent: {props.count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `App` component manages the state (count) and passes it down to the `ChildComponent` as a prop. When the "Increment" button is clicked, it calls the `incrementCount` function in the `App` component to update the count, and the updated count is reflected in the `ChildComponent`.

This pattern allows you to manage shared state in a more centralized manner and make your React application more maintainable and predictable.


This completes lifting state up! Moving state into the common parent component allowed you to coordinate the two panels. Using the active index instead of two “is shown” flags ensured that only one panel is active at a given time. And passing down the event handler to the child allowed the child to change the parent’s state.
