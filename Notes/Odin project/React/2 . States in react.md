### Intro 
- In simple words state is a component memory 
- The `useState` hook is a built-in hook in React that allows you to define state in a functional component. It takes an initial value as a parameter and returns an array with two elements that we can destructure to get.
	1. The current state value
	2. A function to update the state value
State definition with `useState` commonly follows this pattern:

```js
const [stateValue, setStateValue] = useState(initialValue);

// adapted for our use case:
const [backgroundColor, setBackgroundColor] = useState(initialColor);
```

### What is going on under the hood 
In React, when a component’s state or props change, the component is destroyed and recreated from scratch.
This includes the variables, functions, and React nodes. The entire component is recreated but this time the latest state value will be returned from `useState`. This process is called rerendering.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
const COLORS = ["pink", "green", "blue", "yellow", "purple"];

function App() {
  const [backgroundColor, setBackgroundColor] = useState(COLORS[0]);

  const onButtonClick = (color) => () => {
    setBackgroundColor(color);
  };

  return (
    <div
      className="App"
      style={{
        backgroundColor,
      }}
    >
      {COLORS.map((color) => (
        <button
          type="button"
          key={color}
          onClick={onButtonClick(color)}
          className={backgroundColor === color ? "selected" : ""}
        >
          {color}
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```
using this example 
Whenever `setBackgroundColor` is called, our `App` component is rerendered. Essentially, the component is recreated which means the `onButtonClick` function and our `div` and `button`’s are recreated as well. You might wonder, shouldn’t the `backgroundColor` state be recreated as well? Well, React takes the responsibility of keeping track of the latest state and providing it to the component. The initial state value is only used for the component’s first render and is ignored on subsequent renders.

### Hooks 
Hooks are functions that let you use React features. All hooks are recognizable by the `use` prefix. For example, `useState` is a hook. We’ll use more of these as we get further into the course. For now, remember that hooks have rules that we need to abide by:

1. Hooks can only be called from the top level of a functional component.
2. Hooks can’t be called from inside loops or conditions.

### More of state 

#### What is the issue with this 
```jsx
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  let index = 0;

  function handleClick() {
    index = index + 1;
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
      <p>
        {sculpture.description}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```
The `handleClick` event handler is updating a local variable, `index`. But two things prevent that change from being visible:
1. **Local variables don’t persist between renders.** When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch—it doesn’t consider any changes to the local variables.
2. **Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders.** React doesn’t realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.

To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:
1. **Retain** the data between renders.
2. **Trigger** React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).

The `useState` Hook provides those two things:
1. A **state variable** to retain the data between renders.
2. A **state setter function** to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.

#### Using useState
- Importing 
`import { useState } from 'react'`
- destructing 
`const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);`
here index is a variable and setIndex is a function 

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
      <p>
        {sculpture.description}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```
Code using useState
### Giving component a multiple state variable 
We can have as many state variable as we like in a component 
example of 2 state variable 
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details
      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
    </>
  );
}

```

### State is private and isolated
**if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state!** Changing one of them will not affect the other.

```jsx
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="Page">
      <Gallery />
      <Gallery />
    </div>
  );
}
```
This is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it’s “local” to the specific place on the screen

Unlike props, **state is fully private to the component declaring it.** The parent component can’t change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.
