Before your components are displayed on screen, they must be rendered by React.

UI steps in react  , here react is the waiter and components are cooks:
1. **Triggering** a render (delivering the guest’s order to the kitchen)
2. **Rendering** the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
3. **Committing** to the DOM (placing the order on the table)

### Step 1 Triggering a render 
- When 
	- It is component initial render 
	- State of component(or one of its ancestors state) has changed 
- Initial render 
	- it’s done by calling `createRoot` with the target DOM node, and then calling its `render` method with your component:
```jsx
import Image from './Image.js';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<Image />);
```
- Re-render when state updates 
	- Once the component has been initially rendered, you can trigger further renders by updating its state with the `set` function. Updating your component’s state automatically queues a render.

### Step 2. react render components
- Rendering means react calling the components 
	- **On initial render,** React will call the root component.
	- **For subsequent renders,** React will call the function component whose state update triggered the render.
- This process is recursive: if the updated component returns some other component, React will render _that_ component next, and if that component also returns something, it will render _that_ component next, and so on. The process will continue until there are no more nested components and React knows exactly what should be displayed on screen.
```jsx
export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Inspiring Sculptures</h1>
      <Image />
      <Image />
      <Image />
    </section>
  );
}

function Image() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/ZF6s192.jpg"
      alt="'Floralis Genérica' by Eduardo Catalano: a gigantic metallic flower sculpture with reflective petals"
    />
  );
}

```
- **During the initial render,** React will create the DOM nodes for `<section>`, `<h1>`, and three `<img>` tags.
- **During a re-render,** React will calculate which of their properties, if any, have changed since the previous render. It won’t do anything with that information until the next step, the commit phase.
### Step 3 . React commits changes to DOM
After rendering (calling) your components, React will modify the DOM.

- **For the initial render,** React will use the [`appendChild()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild) DOM API to put all the DOM nodes it has created on screen.
- **For re-renders,** React will apply the minimal necessary operations (calculated while rendering!) to make the DOM match the latest rendering output.

**React only changes the DOM nodes if there’s a difference between renders.** For example, here is a component that re-renders with different props passed from its parent every second. Notice how you can add some text into the `<input>`, updating its `value`, but the text doesn’t disappear when the component re-renders:
```jsx
export default function Clock({ time }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{time}</h1>
      <input />
    </>
  );
}
```
This works because during this last step, React only updates the content of `<h1>` with the new `time`. It sees that the `<input>` appears in the JSX in the same place as last time, so React doesn’t touch the `<input>`—or its `value`!
