## What is collection framework
The Java Collections Framework is a set of interfaces and classes in the packages
java.util and java.util.concurrent. They provide client programs with various mod-
els of how to organize their objects, and various implementations of each model. These
models are sometimes called abstract data types, and we need them because different
programs need different ways of organizing their objects

- here you can see that iterable interface is outside the framework collection
- Iterable defines the contract that a class has to fulfill for its instances to be usable with the foreach statement.
#### And the Framework interfaces have the following purposes:
• Collection contains the core functionality required of any collection other than a
map. It has no direct concrete implementations; the concrete collection classes all
implement one of its subinterfaces as well.
• Set is a collection, without duplicates, in which order is not significant. Sorted
Set automatically sorts its elements and returns them in order. NavigableSet ex-
tends this, adding methods to find the closest matches to a target element.
• Queue is a collection designed to accept elements at its tail for processing, yielding
them up at its head in the order in which they are to be processed. Its subinterface
Deque extends this by allowing elements to be added or removed at both head and
tail. Queue and Deque have subinterfaces, BlockingQueue and BlockingDeque respec-
tively, that support concurrent access and allow threads to be blocked, indefinitely
or for a maximum time, until the requested operation can be carried out.
• List is a collection in which order is significant, accommodating duplicate ele-
ments.
• Map is a collection which uses key-value associations to store and retrieve elements.
It is extended by ConcurrentMap, which provides support for concurrent access, by
SortedMap, which guarantees to return its values in ascending key order, by Navi
gable-Map which extends SortedMap to find the closest matches to a target element,
and by ConcurrentNavigableMap which extends ConcurrentMap and NavigableMap.
