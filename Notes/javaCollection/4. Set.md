## Intro
A set is a collection of items that cannot contain duplicates; adding an item if it is already
present in the set has no effect

The Set interface has the same methods as those of Collection, but it is defined separately in order to allow the contract of add (and addAll, which is defined in terms of add) to be changed in this way
## Implementing set
There are six concrete implementations of Set in the Collections Framework

### HashSet
This class is the most commonly used implementation of Set. As the name implies, it
is implemented by a hash table, an array in which elements are stored at a position
derived from their contents

An elementâ€™s position in a hash table is calculated by a hash function of its contents.
Hash functions are designed to give, as far as possible, an even spread of results (hash
codes) over the element values that might be stored

Traditionally, hash tables calculate an index for storing and retrieving elements by using the remainder after division of a hash code by the length of the table. However, in the Java Collections Framework and similar implementations, a different technique is used. Instead of division, they employ bit masking, which involves working with the binary representation of the hash code. Additionally, prime numbers, such as 31, are often used in the hash code calculation. Here's an explanation of why these practices are employed:

1. **Bit Masking**: Bit masking involves using a binary mask to extract specific bits from a number. In the context of hash codes, it means looking at a certain number of least significant bits in the binary representation of the hash code. Bit masking is a faster operation than division because it involves bitwise operations, which are generally quicker for the computer to execute.

2. **Significance of Low-End Bits**: The low-end bits of the hash code are crucial for determining the index in the hash table. This is because these bits have a more pronounced impact on the calculated index. By using bit masking, you can efficiently focus on these significant bits.

3. **Prime Numbers**: When designing a hash function, choosing prime numbers, like 31, is common practice. When you multiply a number by a prime, it helps distribute the hash code's bits more evenly across the index range. This minimizes the risk of information being shifted away from the lower bits, which could lead to clustering (many elements mapping to the same index) and reduced hash table performance. In essence, using a prime number in multiplication contributes to a more even distribution of elements within the table.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the importance of prime numbers in hash code calculation:

Suppose we have a simple hash code calculation using division with a non-prime number, like 8:

- Hash code: 16
- Table length: 8
- Index calculation: `16 % 8` results in an index of 0.

In this case, all elements with hash codes that are multiples of 8 (e.g., 16, 24, 32, etc.) will map to index 0, creating clustering. To avoid this, using a prime number in multiplication (like 31) helps to disperse these elements more evenly across the table, reducing clustering and improving the efficiency of hash table operations.

So, in summary, the use of bit masking and prime numbers in hash code calculations is a performance optimization technique. It helps ensure a more even distribution of elements in the hash table, reducing the likelihood of collisions and improving the overall efficiency of hash table operations in the Java Collections Framework and similar implementations.

Iterating over a hash table requires each bucket to be examined to see whether it is
occupied and therefore costs a time proportional to the capacity of the hash table plus
the number of elements it contains. Since the iterator examines each bucket in turn,
the order in which elements are returned depends on their hash codes, so there is no
guarantee as to the order in which the elements will be returned.

**The chief attraction of a hash table implementation for sets is the (ideally) constant-
time performance for the basic operations of add, remove, contains, and size. Its main
disadvantage is its iteration performance; since iterating through the table involves
examining every bucket, its cost is proportional to the table size regardless of the size
of the set it contains.**

HashSet has the standard constructors that we introduced [[3. Collection interface#Two common type of constructor shared by most collection implementations]], together with
two additional constructors:
```java
HashSet(int initialCapacity)
HashSet(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)
```
HashSet is unsychronized and not thread-safe; its iterators are fail-fast
#### Important methods 
Here's the information converted into a table format:

| SN | Modifier & Type | Method | Description |
|----|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| 1  | boolean         | add(E e) | It is used to add the specified element to this set if it is not already present. |
| 2  | void            | clear() | It is used to remove all of the elements from the set. |
| 3  | Object          | clone() | It is used to return a shallow copy of this HashSet instance: the elements themselves are not cloned. |
| 4  | boolean         | contains(Object o) | It is used to return true if this set contains the specified element. |
| 5  | boolean         | isEmpty() | It is used to return true if this set contains no elements. |
| 6  | Iterator`<E>`     | iterator() | It is used to return an iterator over the elements in this set. |
| 7  | boolean         | remove(Object o) | It is used to remove the specified element from this set if it is present. |
| 8  | int             | size() | It is used to return the number of elements in the set. |

To add all elements from one `HashSet` to another, you can use the `addAll` method. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class HashSetAddAllExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create two HashSet objects
        HashSet<String> set1 = new HashSet<>();
        HashSet<String> set2 = new HashSet<>();

        // Add elements to the first HashSet
        set1.add("Apple");
        set1.add("Banana");
        set1.add("Cherry");

        // Add elements to the second HashSet
        set2.add("Date");
        set2.add("Elderberry");

        // Use the addAll method to add all elements from set2 to set1
        set1.addAll(set2);

        // Display the elements in set1 after adding all elements from set2
        System.out.println("Elements in set1 after adding all elements from set2:");
        for (String element : set1) {
            System.out.println(element);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. We create two `HashSet` objects, `set1` and `set2`.
2. We add elements to both `set1` and `set2`.
3. We use the `addAll` method to add all elements from `set2` to `set1`.
4. After adding all elements from `set2` to `set1`, we iterate through the elements in `set1` and print them.

The `addAll` method is used to merge the elements from one `HashSet` into another. After running this code, you will see the elements from both sets in `set1`.

Here's an example of how to use an iterator with a `HashSet` in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class HashSetIteratorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a HashSet of Strings
        HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();

        // Add elements to the HashSet
        set.add("Apple");
        set.add("Banana");
        set.add("Cherry");
        set.add("Date");
        set.add("Elderberry");

        // Create an iterator for the HashSet
        Iterator<String> iterator = set.iterator();

        // Iterate through the elements using the iterator
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            String element = iterator.next();
            System.out.println(element);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. We create a `HashSet` of Strings and add several elements to it.
2. We create an `Iterator` for the `HashSet` using the `iterator()` method.
3. We use a `while` loop to iterate through the elements in the `HashSet` using the iterator. The `hasNext()` method checks if there are more elements to iterate, and the `next()` method retrieves the next element.
4. We print each element to the console.

This code will output the elements in an arbitrary order, as `HashSet` does not guarantee any specific order of elements.

### LinkedHashSet

This class inherits from HashSet, still implementing Set and refining the contract of its
superclass in only one respect: it guarantees that its iterators will return their elements
in the order in which they were first added

The linked structure also has a useful consequence in terms of improved performance
for iteration: next performs in constant time, as the linked list can be used to visit each
element in turn. This is in contrast to HashSet, for which every bucket in the hash table
must be visited whether it is occupied or not, but the overhead involved in maintaining
the linked list means that you would choose LinkedHashSet in preference to HashSet
only if the orde or the efficiency of iteration were important for your application.

Methods are same as hashset
