## Intro
A list is a collection which—unlike a set—can contain duplicates, and which—unlike a queue—gives the user full visibility and control over the ordering of its elements.
## Positional access 
```java
void add(int index, E e)
// add element e at given index
boolean addAll(int index, Collection<? extends E> c)
// add contents of c at given index
E get(int index)
// return element with given index
E remove(int index)
// remove element with given index
E set(int index, E e)
// replace element with given index by e
```

## Search 
```java
int indexOf(Object o)
int lastIndexOf(Object o)
// return index of first occurrence of o
// return index of last occurrence of o
```
## Range view 
```java
List<E> subList(int fromIndex, int toIndex)
// return a view of a portion of the list
```
the returned list contains the list elements starting at fromIndex, up to but not including
to Index.

The explanation you've provided pertains to the behavior of sublists in the context of Java's `List` interface, specifically when dealing with the `subList` method. Let's break down the key points in this context:

1. **View of the Original List:** When you create a sublist using the `subList` method, it doesn't create a separate list with its own elements. Instead, it provides a "view" of a portion of the original list. This means that the sublist references the same elements as the original list.
2. **Changes are Reflected in the Original List:** Any changes you make to the sublist are directly reflected in the original list. This includes adding, removing, or modifying elements in the sublist. Since both the sublist and the original list point to the same underlying elements, there's no distinction between them in terms of content.
3. **Write-Through Behavior:** The term "write-through" refers to the behavior where changes made in the sublist are written through to the backing list (i.e., the original list). This is a direct consequence of the sublist being a view of the original list.
4. **Important Difference from `subSet`:** The explanation mentions an important difference from the `subSet` method. In Java, the `subSet` method returns a view of the original set, but it does not have the same write-through behavior as `subList`. In a `subSet`, changes made to the original set are not automatically reflected in the subset, and changes in the subset do not affect the original set. This is the key distinction.
5. **ConcurrentModificationException:** The text also warns that if elements have been inserted into or removed from the original list (the "backing list") directly, using methods like `add` or `remove` on the original list, and you subsequently attempt to use the sublist, it can lead to a `ConcurrentModificationException`. This exception is thrown to prevent concurrent modification of a data structure (in this case, a list) to maintain data integrity.

In summary, when you work with sublists created using the `subList` method in Java, you need to be aware of their write-through behavior and the potential for `ConcurrentModificationException` if you modify the original list while working with the sublist. This behavior can be useful for some use cases but requires careful handling to avoid unexpected issues.

## List iteration
Methods that return a ListIterator, which is an Iterator with extended
semantics to take advantage of the list’s sequential nature:

```java
ListIterator<E> listIterator()
// return a ListIterator for this list,
// initially positioned at index 0
ListIterator<E> listIterator(int indx)
// return a ListIterator for this list,
// initially positioned at index indx
```
To the Iterator methods hasNext, next, and remove, ListIterator adds the following
methods:
```java
public interface ListIterator<E> extends Iterator<E> {
void add(E e);
// insert the specified element into the list
boolean hasPrevious(); // return true if this list iterator has further
// elements in the reverse direction
int nextIndex();
// return the index of the element that would be
// returned by a subsequent call to next
E previous(); // return the previous element in the list
int previousIndex(); // return the index of the element that would be
```

Consider an iterator at position 2, either moved there from elsewhere or created there by a call to listIterator (2). The effect of most of the operations of this iterator is intuitive; add inserts an element at the current iterator position (between the elements at index 1 and 2), hasPrevious and hasNext return true, previous and next return the elements at indices 1 and 2 respectively, and previousIndex and nextIndex return those indices themselves. At the extreme positions of the list, 0 and 3 in the figure, previousIndex and nextIndex would return -1 and 3 (the size of the list) respectively, and previous or next, respectively, would throw No Such Element Exception.

## Implementing List

### ArrayList

Arrays are provided as part of the Java language and have a very convenient syntax, but
their key disadvantage—that, once created, they cannot be resized—makes them in-
creasingly less popular than List implementations, which (if resizable at all) are indef-
initely extensible

The standard implementation of ArrayList stores the List elements in contiguous array
locations,

### LinkedList
We discussed LinkedList as a Deque implementation in Section 14.4.1. You will avoid
it as a List implementation if your application makes much use of random access; since
the list must iterate internally to reach the required position, positional add and
remove have linear time complexity, on average. Where LinkedList does have a per-
formance advantage over ArrayList is in adding and removing elements anywhere other
than at the end of the list; for LinkedList this takes constant time, against the linear
time required for noncircular array implementations.

### CopyOnWriteArrayList
This combination of thread safety with fast read access is useful in some concurrent programs, especially when a collection of observer objects needs to receive frequent event notifications. The cost is that the array which backs the collection has to be treated as immutable, so a new copy is created whenever any changes are made to the collection. This cost may not be too high to pay if changes in the set of observers occur only rarely
