## Intro
It defines the operations that are supported by a set of key-to-value associations in which the keys are unique

### Adding Association
```java
V put(K key, V value)
// add or replace a key-value association
// return the old value (may be null) if the
// key was present; otherwise returns null
void putAll(Map<? extends K,? extends V> m)
// add each of the key-value associations in
// the supplied map into the receiver
```
### removing association
```java
void clear()  // remove all associations from this map
V remove(Object key)
// remove the association, if any, with the
// given key; returns the value with which it
// was associated, or null
```

### Querying the content
```java
V get(Object k)
// return the value corresponding to k, or
// null if k is not present as a key
boolean containsKey(Object k)
// return true if k is present as a key
boolean containsValue(Object v) // return true if v is present as a value
int size()
// return the number of associations
boolean isEmpty()
// return true if there are no associations
```
### Providing Collection Views of the Keys, Values, or Associations:
```java
Set<Map.Entry<K, V>> entrySet() // return a Set view of the associations
Set<K> keySet()
// return a Set view of the keys
Collection<V> values()
// return a Collection view of the values
```

## Implementation
Every implementation excluding EnumMap has at least two constructors; taking HashMap as an example, they are:
```java
public HashMap()
public HashMap(Map<? extends K,? extends V> m)
```

#### HashMap
HashMap provides constant-time performance for put and get. Although in principle
constant-time performance is only attainable with no collisions, it can be closely ap-
proached by the use of rehashing to control the load and thereby to minimize the num-
ber of collisions.

Two constructors allow the programmer to configure a new instance of HashMap:
```java
public HashMap(int initialCapacity)
public HashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)
```
#### LinkedHashMap
LinkedHashMap offers a choice of iteration orders; elements can be returned either in the order in which they were inserted in the map,or in the order in which they were accessed (from least-recently to most-recently accessed).
An accessordered LinkedHashMap is created by supplying an argument of true for the
last parameter of the constructor:
```java
public LinkedHashMap(int initialCapacity,
float loadFactor,
boolean accessOrder)
```

Access-ordered maps are especially useful for constructing Least Recently Used (LRU)
caches

The `removeEldestEntry` method in a `LinkedHashMap` class is a crucial method that allows subclasses to control the removal of the eldest entry in the map. Its primary purpose is to determine when the map reaches a specified maximum size and to delete the eldest entry when a new entry is added, thereby maintaining the map's size.

Here is an example of how `removeEldestEntry` might be used to restrict the size of a `LinkedHashMap` by removing the eldest entry when the maximum size is reached:

```java
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class SizeLimitedMap<K, V> extends LinkedHashMap<K, V> {
    private final int maxSize;

    public SizeLimitedMap(int maxSize) {
        super();
        this.maxSize = maxSize;
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean removeEldestEntry(Map.Entry<K, V> eldest) {
        return size() > maxSize;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SizeLimitedMap<Integer, String> sizeLimitedMap = new SizeLimitedMap<>(3);

        sizeLimitedMap.put(1, "One");
        sizeLimitedMap.put(2, "Two");
        sizeLimitedMap.put(3, "Three");

        System.out.println("Map content after initial addition: " + sizeLimitedMap);

        sizeLimitedMap.put(4, "Four");

        System.out.println("Map content after exceeding the maximum size: " + sizeLimitedMap);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `SizeLimitedMap` class extends `LinkedHashMap` and overrides the `removeEldestEntry` method to control the maximum size of the map. The `removeEldestEntry` method returns `true` if the size of the map exceeds the `maxSize` specified during its initialization. When `put` is called to add a new entry that would exceed the maximum size, the `removeEldestEntry` method triggers the removal of the eldest entry, thus maintaining the maximum size.

This approach allows the map to automatically manage its size by removing the eldest (least recently added or accessed) entry whenever a new entry is added after reaching the specified maximum size. The `removeEldestEntry` method returns `false` after removing the eldest entry to signal that the removal has been handled and it is not necessary for the calling method to perform the removal.

This kind of functionality is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to limit the size of a cache or manage resources within a specific threshold in an ordered manner.

#### WeakHashMap
`WeakHashMap` is a class in Java that provides an implementation of the `Map` interface, similar to `HashMap`, but with one key difference: its keys are stored as weak references. This distinction is significant because the keys held in a `WeakHashMap` can be garbage collected if there are no strong references to those keys elsewhere in the program.

The main difference between a `WeakHashMap` and a regular `HashMap` lies in the way they handle key references:

1. **Garbage Collection behavior:**
   - In a regular `HashMap`, as long as the key is in the map, it will be held by the map and won't be garbage collected even if there are no other references to it. This might cause memory leaks in situations where keys are no longer needed but are still being held in the map.
   - In a `WeakHashMap`, keys are held using weak references. If the only remaining references to a key are weak references held by the `WeakHashMap`, the key is eligible for garbage collection. This allows the key-value pair to be automatically removed from the `WeakHashMap` when the key is no longer strongly reachable.

2. **Usage and Caveats:**
   - `WeakHashMap` is particularly useful in scenarios where you want the entries to be automatically removed when keys are no longer used elsewhere in the program.
   - However, the usage of weak references also means that the keys might disappear unexpectedly, potentially affecting the behavior of the map. Therefore, `WeakHashMap` is generally used in specific cases and requires careful consideration of the application's requirements and potential side effects.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the behavior of a `WeakHashMap`:

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.WeakHashMap;

public class WeakHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Key, String> weakHashMap = new WeakHashMap<>();

        Key key = new Key(1);
        weakHashMap.put(key, "Value");

        System.out.println("Map content: " + weakHashMap);

        // Making key eligible for garbage collection
        key = null;

        // Run the garbage collector
        System.gc();

        // Display the map after garbage collection
        System.out.println("Map content after key becomes weakly reachable: " + weakHashMap);
    }

    static class Key {
        private int id;

        Key(int id) {
            this.id = id;
        }

        // For simplicity, equals and hashCode methods are overridden
        @Override
        public boolean equals(Object obj) {
            if (this == obj) return true;
            if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
            Key key = (Key) obj;
            return id == key.id;
        }

        @Override
        public int hashCode() {
            return id;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `WeakHashMap` contains an entry with a custom `Key` object. Once the `Key` object is made unreachable (by setting `key = null`), upon garbage collection, the entry associated with the key will be removed from the `WeakHashMap`.

`WeakHashMap` is a specialized data structure in Java, designed to address specific use cases where automatic removal of entries upon key unreachability is desired. However, it should be used with caution due to its behavior when dealing with weakly referenced keys.
